"Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?"
"Ay."
"Where may we set our horses?"
"I' the mire."
"Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me."
"I love thee not."
"Why, then, I care not for thee."
"If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee"
"care for me."
"Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not."
"Fellow, I know thee."
"What dost thou know me for?"
"A knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats, a"
"base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,"
"hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave, a"
"lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,"
"glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue,"
"one-trunk-inheriting slave, one that wouldst be a"
"bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but"
"the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,"
"and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I"
"will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest"
"the least syllable of thy addition."
"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail"
"on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!"
"What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou"
"knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up"
"t'hy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you"
"rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon"
"shines, I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:"
"draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw."
"Drawing his sword"
"Away! I have nothing to do with thee."
"Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the"
"king, and take vanity the puppet's part against the"
"royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so"
"carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal, come your ways."
"Help, ho! murder! help!"
"Strike, you slave, stand, rogue, stand, you neat"
"slave, strike."
"Beating him"
"Help, ho! murder! murder!"
