1,Henry IV,,,,ACT I
2,Henry IV,,,,SCENE I. London. The palace.
3,Henry IV,,,,"Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others"
4,Henry IV,1,1.1.1,KING HENRY IV,"So shaken as we are, so wan with care,"
5,Henry IV,1,1.1.2,KING HENRY IV,"Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,"
6,Henry IV,1,1.1.3,KING HENRY IV,And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
7,Henry IV,1,1.1.4,KING HENRY IV,To be commenced in strands afar remote.
8,Henry IV,1,1.1.5,KING HENRY IV,No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
9,Henry IV,1,1.1.6,KING HENRY IV,"Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood,"
10,Henry IV,1,1.1.7,KING HENRY IV,"Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,"
11,Henry IV,1,1.1.8,KING HENRY IV,Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
12,Henry IV,1,1.1.9,KING HENRY IV,"Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,"
13,Henry IV,1,1.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,"
14,Henry IV,1,1.1.11,KING HENRY IV,"All of one nature, of one substance bred,"
15,Henry IV,1,1.1.12,KING HENRY IV,Did lately meet in the intestine shock
16,Henry IV,1,1.1.13,KING HENRY IV,And furious close of civil butchery
17,Henry IV,1,1.1.14,KING HENRY IV,"Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,"
18,Henry IV,1,1.1.15,KING HENRY IV,March all one way and be no more opposed
19,Henry IV,1,1.1.16,KING HENRY IV,"Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:"
20,Henry IV,1,1.1.17,KING HENRY IV,"The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,"
21,Henry IV,1,1.1.18,KING HENRY IV,"No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,"
22,Henry IV,1,1.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,"
23,Henry IV,1,1.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross"
24,Henry IV,1,1.1.21,KING HENRY IV,"We are impressed and engaged to fight,"
25,Henry IV,1,1.1.22,KING HENRY IV,"Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,"
26,Henry IV,1,1.1.23,KING HENRY IV,Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
27,Henry IV,1,1.1.24,KING HENRY IV,To chase these pagans in those holy fields
28,Henry IV,1,1.1.25,KING HENRY IV,Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
29,Henry IV,1,1.1.26,KING HENRY IV,Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
30,Henry IV,1,1.1.27,KING HENRY IV,For our advantage on the bitter cross.
31,Henry IV,1,1.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"But this our purpose now is twelve month old,"
32,Henry IV,1,1.1.29,KING HENRY IV,And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
33,Henry IV,1,1.1.30,KING HENRY IV,Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
34,Henry IV,1,1.1.31,KING HENRY IV,"Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,"
35,Henry IV,1,1.1.32,KING HENRY IV,What yesternight our council did decree
36,Henry IV,1,1.1.33,KING HENRY IV,In forwarding this dear expedience.
37,Henry IV,2,1.1.34,WESTMORELAND,"My liege, this haste was hot in question,"
38,Henry IV,2,1.1.35,WESTMORELAND,And many limits of the charge set down
39,Henry IV,2,1.1.36,WESTMORELAND,But yesternight: when all athwart there came
40,Henry IV,2,1.1.37,WESTMORELAND,"A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,"
41,Henry IV,2,1.1.38,WESTMORELAND,"Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,"
42,Henry IV,2,1.1.39,WESTMORELAND,Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
43,Henry IV,2,1.1.40,WESTMORELAND,"Against the irregular and wild Glendower,"
44,Henry IV,2,1.1.41,WESTMORELAND,"Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,"
45,Henry IV,2,1.1.42,WESTMORELAND,"A thousand of his people butchered,"
46,Henry IV,2,1.1.43,WESTMORELAND,"Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,"
47,Henry IV,2,1.1.44,WESTMORELAND,"Such beastly shameless transformation,"
48,Henry IV,2,1.1.45,WESTMORELAND,By those Welshwomen done as may not be
49,Henry IV,2,1.1.46,WESTMORELAND,Without much shame retold or spoken of.
50,Henry IV,3,1.1.47,KING HENRY IV,It seems then that the tidings of this broil
51,Henry IV,3,1.1.48,KING HENRY IV,Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
52,Henry IV,4,1.1.49,WESTMORELAND,"This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,"
53,Henry IV,4,1.1.50,WESTMORELAND,For more uneven and unwelcome news
54,Henry IV,4,1.1.51,WESTMORELAND,Came from the north and thus it did import:
55,Henry IV,4,1.1.52,WESTMORELAND,"On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,"
56,Henry IV,4,1.1.53,WESTMORELAND,"Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,"
57,Henry IV,4,1.1.54,WESTMORELAND,"That ever-valiant and approved Scot,"
58,Henry IV,4,1.1.55,WESTMORELAND,"At Holmedon met,"
59,Henry IV,4,1.1.56,WESTMORELAND,"Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,"
60,Henry IV,4,1.1.57,WESTMORELAND,"As by discharge of their artillery,"
61,Henry IV,4,1.1.58,WESTMORELAND,"And shape of likelihood, the news was told,"
62,Henry IV,4,1.1.59,WESTMORELAND,"For he that brought them, in the very heat"
63,Henry IV,4,1.1.60,WESTMORELAND,"And pride of their contention did take horse,"
64,Henry IV,4,1.1.61,WESTMORELAND,Uncertain of the issue any way.
65,Henry IV,5,1.1.62,KING HENRY IV,"Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,"
66,Henry IV,5,1.1.63,KING HENRY IV,"Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse."
67,Henry IV,5,1.1.64,KING HENRY IV,Stain'd with the variation of each soil
68,Henry IV,5,1.1.65,KING HENRY IV,"Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours,"
69,Henry IV,5,1.1.66,KING HENRY IV,And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
70,Henry IV,5,1.1.67,KING HENRY IV,The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
71,Henry IV,5,1.1.68,KING HENRY IV,"Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,"
72,Henry IV,5,1.1.69,KING HENRY IV,Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
73,Henry IV,5,1.1.70,KING HENRY IV,"On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took"
74,Henry IV,5,1.1.71,KING HENRY IV,"Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son"
75,Henry IV,5,1.1.72,KING HENRY IV,"To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,"
76,Henry IV,5,1.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:"
77,Henry IV,5,1.1.74,KING HENRY IV,And is not this an honourable spoil?
78,Henry IV,5,1.1.75,KING HENRY IV,"A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?"
79,Henry IV,6,1.1.76,WESTMORELAND,"In faith,"
80,Henry IV,6,1.1.77,WESTMORELAND,It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
81,Henry IV,7,1.1.78,KING HENRY IV,"Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin"
82,Henry IV,7,1.1.79,KING HENRY IV,In envy that my Lord Northumberland
83,Henry IV,7,1.1.80,KING HENRY IV,"Should be the father to so blest a son,"
84,Henry IV,7,1.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"A son who is the theme of honour's tongue,"
85,Henry IV,7,1.1.82,KING HENRY IV,"Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,"
86,Henry IV,7,1.1.83,KING HENRY IV,Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
87,Henry IV,7,1.1.84,KING HENRY IV,"Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,"
88,Henry IV,7,1.1.85,KING HENRY IV,See riot and dishonour stain the brow
89,Henry IV,7,1.1.86,KING HENRY IV,Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
90,Henry IV,7,1.1.87,KING HENRY IV,That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
91,Henry IV,7,1.1.88,KING HENRY IV,"In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,"
92,Henry IV,7,1.1.89,KING HENRY IV,"And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!"
93,Henry IV,7,1.1.90,KING HENRY IV,"Then would I have his Harry, and he mine."
94,Henry IV,7,1.1.91,KING HENRY IV,"But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,"
95,Henry IV,7,1.1.92,KING HENRY IV,"Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,"
96,Henry IV,7,1.1.93,KING HENRY IV,"Which he in this adventure hath surprised,"
97,Henry IV,7,1.1.94,KING HENRY IV,"To his own use he keeps, and sends me word,"
98,Henry IV,7,1.1.95,KING HENRY IV,I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
99,Henry IV,8,1.1.96,WESTMORELAND,"This is his uncle's teaching, this is Worcester,"
100,Henry IV,8,1.1.97,WESTMORELAND,"Malevolent to you in all aspects,"
101,Henry IV,8,1.1.98,WESTMORELAND,"Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up"
102,Henry IV,8,1.1.99,WESTMORELAND,The crest of youth against your dignity.
103,Henry IV,9,1.1.100,KING HENRY IV,"But I have sent for him to answer this,"
104,Henry IV,9,1.1.101,KING HENRY IV,And for this cause awhile we must neglect
105,Henry IV,9,1.1.102,KING HENRY IV,Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
106,Henry IV,9,1.1.103,KING HENRY IV,"Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we"
107,Henry IV,9,1.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords:"
108,Henry IV,9,1.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"But come yourself with speed to us again,"
109,Henry IV,9,1.1.106,KING HENRY IV,For more is to be said and to be done
110,Henry IV,9,1.1.107,KING HENRY IV,Than out of anger can be uttered.
111,Henry IV,10,1.1.108,WESTMORELAND,"I will, my liege."
112,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,Exeunt
113,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.
114,Henry IV,10,,WESTMORELAND,Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF
115,Henry IV,1,1.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?"
116,Henry IV,2,1.2.2,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack"
117,Henry IV,2,1.2.3,PRINCE HENRY,and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
118,Henry IV,2,1.2.4,PRINCE HENRY,"benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to"
119,Henry IV,2,1.2.5,PRINCE HENRY,demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
120,Henry IV,2,1.2.6,PRINCE HENRY,What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
121,Henry IV,2,1.2.7,PRINCE HENRY,day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
122,Henry IV,2,1.2.8,PRINCE HENRY,capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
123,Henry IV,2,1.2.9,PRINCE HENRY,signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
124,Henry IV,2,1.2.10,PRINCE HENRY,"a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no"
125,Henry IV,2,1.2.11,PRINCE HENRY,reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
126,Henry IV,2,1.2.12,PRINCE HENRY,the time of the day.
127,Henry IV,3,1.2.13,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, you come near me now, Hal, for we that take"
128,Henry IV,3,1.2.14,FALSTAFF,"purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not"
129,Henry IV,3,1.2.15,FALSTAFF,"by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,"
130,Henry IV,3,1.2.16,FALSTAFF,"I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God"
131,Henry IV,3,1.2.17,FALSTAFF,"save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace"
132,Henry IV,3,1.2.18,FALSTAFF,"thou wilt have none,--"
133,Henry IV,4,1.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,"What, none?"
134,Henry IV,5,1.2.20,FALSTAFF,"No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to"
135,Henry IV,5,1.2.21,FALSTAFF,prologue to an egg and butter.
136,Henry IV,6,1.2.22,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly."
137,Henry IV,7,1.2.23,FALSTAFF,"Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not"
138,Henry IV,7,1.2.24,FALSTAFF,us that are squires of the night's body be called
139,Henry IV,7,1.2.25,FALSTAFF,thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
140,Henry IV,7,1.2.26,FALSTAFF,"foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the"
141,Henry IV,7,1.2.27,FALSTAFF,"moon, and let men say we be men of good government,"
142,Henry IV,7,1.2.28,FALSTAFF,"being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and"
143,Henry IV,7,1.2.29,FALSTAFF,"chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal."
144,Henry IV,8,1.2.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the"
145,Henry IV,8,1.2.31,PRINCE HENRY,fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
146,Henry IV,8,1.2.32,PRINCE HENRY,"flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,"
147,Henry IV,8,1.2.33,PRINCE HENRY,"by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold"
148,Henry IV,8,1.2.34,PRINCE HENRY,most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
149,Henry IV,8,1.2.35,PRINCE HENRY,"dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning, got with"
150,Henry IV,8,1.2.36,PRINCE HENRY,"swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in,'"
151,Henry IV,8,1.2.37,PRINCE HENRY,now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
152,Henry IV,8,1.2.38,PRINCE HENRY,and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
153,Henry IV,9,1.2.39,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my"
154,Henry IV,9,1.2.40,FALSTAFF,hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
155,Henry IV,10,1.2.41,PRINCE HENRY,"As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And"
156,Henry IV,10,1.2.42,PRINCE HENRY,is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
157,Henry IV,11,1.2.43,FALSTAFF,"How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and"
158,Henry IV,11,1.2.44,FALSTAFF,thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
159,Henry IV,11,1.2.45,FALSTAFF,buff jerkin?
160,Henry IV,12,1.2.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?"
161,Henry IV,13,1.2.47,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a"
162,Henry IV,13,1.2.48,FALSTAFF,time and oft.
163,Henry IV,14,1.2.49,PRINCE HENRY,Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
164,Henry IV,15,1.2.50,FALSTAFF,"No, I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there."
165,Henry IV,16,1.2.51,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch,"
166,Henry IV,16,1.2.52,PRINCE HENRY,"and where it would not, I have used my credit."
167,Henry IV,17,1.2.53,FALSTAFF,"Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent"
168,Henry IV,17,1.2.54,FALSTAFF,"that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet"
169,Henry IV,17,1.2.55,FALSTAFF,"wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when"
170,Henry IV,17,1.2.56,FALSTAFF,thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
171,Henry IV,17,1.2.57,FALSTAFF,with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
172,Henry IV,17,1.2.58,FALSTAFF,"not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief."
173,Henry IV,18,1.2.59,PRINCE HENRY,"No, thou shalt."
174,Henry IV,19,1.2.60,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge."
175,Henry IV,20,1.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have"
176,Henry IV,20,1.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
177,Henry IV,21,1.2.63,FALSTAFF,"Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my"
178,Henry IV,21,1.2.64,FALSTAFF,"humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell"
179,Henry IV,21,1.2.65,FALSTAFF,you.
180,Henry IV,22,1.2.66,PRINCE HENRY,For obtaining of suits?
181,Henry IV,23,1.2.67,FALSTAFF,"Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman"
182,Henry IV,23,1.2.68,FALSTAFF,"hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy"
183,Henry IV,23,1.2.69,FALSTAFF,as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
184,Henry IV,24,1.2.70,PRINCE HENRY,"Or an old lion, or a lover's lute."
185,Henry IV,25,1.2.71,FALSTAFF,"Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe."
186,Henry IV,26,1.2.72,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of"
187,Henry IV,26,1.2.73,PRINCE HENRY,Moor-ditch?
188,Henry IV,27,1.2.74,FALSTAFF,Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
189,Henry IV,27,1.2.75,FALSTAFF,"the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young"
190,Henry IV,27,1.2.76,FALSTAFF,"prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more"
191,Henry IV,27,1.2.77,FALSTAFF,with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
192,Henry IV,27,1.2.78,FALSTAFF,commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
193,Henry IV,27,1.2.79,FALSTAFF,lord of the council rated me the other day in the
194,Henry IV,27,1.2.80,FALSTAFF,"street about you, sir, but I marked him not, and yet"
195,Henry IV,27,1.2.81,FALSTAFF,"he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not, and"
196,Henry IV,27,1.2.82,FALSTAFF,"yet he talked wisely, and in the street too."
197,Henry IV,28,1.2.83,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the"
198,Henry IV,28,1.2.84,PRINCE HENRY,"streets, and no man regards it."
199,Henry IV,29,1.2.85,FALSTAFF,"O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able"
200,Henry IV,29,1.2.86,FALSTAFF,to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
201,Henry IV,29,1.2.87,FALSTAFF,"me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew"
202,Henry IV,29,1.2.88,FALSTAFF,"thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man"
203,Henry IV,29,1.2.89,FALSTAFF,"should speak truly, little better than one of the"
204,Henry IV,29,1.2.90,FALSTAFF,"wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give"
205,Henry IV,29,1.2.91,FALSTAFF,"it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:"
206,Henry IV,29,1.2.92,FALSTAFF,I'll be damned for never a king's son in
207,Henry IV,29,1.2.93,FALSTAFF,Christendom.
208,Henry IV,30,1.2.94,PRINCE HENRY,"Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?"
209,Henry IV,31,1.2.95,FALSTAFF,"'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I'll make one, an I"
210,Henry IV,31,1.2.96,FALSTAFF,"do not, call me villain and baffle me."
211,Henry IV,32,1.2.97,PRINCE HENRY,"I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying"
212,Henry IV,32,1.2.98,PRINCE HENRY,to purse-taking.
213,Henry IV,33,1.2.99,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal, 'tis no sin for a"
214,Henry IV,33,1.2.100,FALSTAFF,man to labour in his vocation.
215,Henry IV,33,,FALSTAFF,Enter POINS
216,Henry IV,33,1.2.101,FALSTAFF,Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
217,Henry IV,33,1.2.102,FALSTAFF,"match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what"
218,Henry IV,33,1.2.103,FALSTAFF,hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
219,Henry IV,33,1.2.104,FALSTAFF,most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
220,Henry IV,33,1.2.105,FALSTAFF,a true man.
221,Henry IV,34,1.2.106,PRINCE HENRY,"Good morrow, Ned."
222,Henry IV,35,1.2.107,POINS,"Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?"
223,Henry IV,35,1.2.108,POINS,what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
224,Henry IV,35,1.2.109,POINS,"agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou"
225,Henry IV,35,1.2.110,POINS,soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
226,Henry IV,35,1.2.111,POINS,and a cold capon's leg?
227,Henry IV,36,1.2.112,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have"
228,Henry IV,36,1.2.113,PRINCE HENRY,"his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of"
229,Henry IV,36,1.2.114,PRINCE HENRY,proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
230,Henry IV,37,1.2.115,POINS,Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
231,Henry IV,38,1.2.116,PRINCE HENRY,Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
232,Henry IV,39,1.2.117,POINS,"But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four"
233,Henry IV,39,1.2.118,POINS,"o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going"
234,Henry IV,39,1.2.119,POINS,"to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders"
235,Henry IV,39,1.2.120,POINS,riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
236,Henry IV,39,1.2.121,POINS,"for you all, you have horses for yourselves:"
237,Henry IV,39,1.2.122,POINS,Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
238,Henry IV,39,1.2.123,POINS,supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
239,Henry IV,39,1.2.124,POINS,"as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff"
240,Henry IV,39,1.2.125,POINS,"your purses full of crowns, if you will not, tarry"
241,Henry IV,39,1.2.126,POINS,at home and be hanged.
242,Henry IV,40,1.2.127,FALSTAFF,"Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not,"
243,Henry IV,40,1.2.128,FALSTAFF,I'll hang you for going.
244,Henry IV,41,1.2.129,POINS,"You will, chops?"
245,Henry IV,42,1.2.130,FALSTAFF,"Hal, wilt thou make one?"
246,Henry IV,43,1.2.131,PRINCE HENRY,"Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith."
247,Henry IV,44,1.2.132,FALSTAFF,"There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good"
248,Henry IV,44,1.2.133,FALSTAFF,"fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood"
249,Henry IV,44,1.2.134,FALSTAFF,"royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings."
250,Henry IV,45,1.2.135,PRINCE HENRY,"Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap."
251,Henry IV,46,1.2.136,FALSTAFF,"Why, that's well said."
252,Henry IV,47,1.2.137,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home."
253,Henry IV,48,1.2.138,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king."
254,Henry IV,49,1.2.139,PRINCE HENRY,I care not.
255,Henry IV,50,1.2.140,POINS,"Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:"
256,Henry IV,50,1.2.141,POINS,I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
257,Henry IV,50,1.2.142,POINS,that he shall go.
258,Henry IV,51,1.2.143,FALSTAFF,"Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him"
259,Henry IV,51,1.2.144,FALSTAFF,"the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may"
260,Henry IV,51,1.2.145,FALSTAFF,"move and what he hears may be believed, that the"
261,Henry IV,51,1.2.146,FALSTAFF,"true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false"
262,Henry IV,51,1.2.147,FALSTAFF,"thief, for the poor abuses of the time want"
263,Henry IV,51,1.2.148,FALSTAFF,countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
264,Henry IV,52,1.2.149,PRINCE HENRY,"Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!"
265,Henry IV,52,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Falstaff
266,Henry IV,53,1.2.150,POINS,"Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us"
267,Henry IV,53,1.2.151,POINS,to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
268,Henry IV,53,1.2.152,POINS,"manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill"
269,Henry IV,53,1.2.153,POINS,shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
270,Henry IV,53,1.2.154,POINS,"yourself and I will not be there, and when they"
271,Henry IV,53,1.2.155,POINS,"have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut"
272,Henry IV,53,1.2.156,POINS,this head off from my shoulders.
273,Henry IV,54,1.2.157,PRINCE HENRY,How shall we part with them in setting forth?
274,Henry IV,55,1.2.158,POINS,"Why, we will set forth before or after them, and"
275,Henry IV,55,1.2.159,POINS,"appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at"
276,Henry IV,55,1.2.160,POINS,"our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure"
277,Henry IV,55,1.2.161,POINS,"upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have"
278,Henry IV,55,1.2.162,POINS,"no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them."
279,Henry IV,56,1.2.163,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our"
280,Henry IV,56,1.2.164,PRINCE HENRY,"horses, by our habits and by every other"
281,Henry IV,56,1.2.165,PRINCE HENRY,"appointment, to be ourselves."
282,Henry IV,57,1.2.166,POINS,Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
283,Henry IV,57,1.2.167,POINS,"in the wood, our vizards we will change after we"
284,Henry IV,57,1.2.168,POINS,"leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram"
285,Henry IV,57,1.2.169,POINS,"for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments."
286,Henry IV,58,1.2.170,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us."
287,Henry IV,59,1.2.171,POINS,"Well, for two of them, I know them to be as"
288,Henry IV,59,1.2.172,POINS,"true-bred cowards as ever turned back, and for the"
289,Henry IV,59,1.2.173,POINS,"third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll"
290,Henry IV,59,1.2.174,POINS,"forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the"
291,Henry IV,59,1.2.175,POINS,incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
292,Henry IV,59,1.2.176,POINS,"tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at"
293,Henry IV,59,1.2.177,POINS,"least, he fought with, what wards, what blows, what"
294,Henry IV,59,1.2.178,POINS,"extremities he endured, and in the reproof of this"
295,Henry IV,59,1.2.179,POINS,lies the jest.
296,Henry IV,60,1.2.180,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things"
297,Henry IV,60,1.2.181,PRINCE HENRY,"necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap,"
298,Henry IV,60,1.2.182,PRINCE HENRY,there I'll sup. Farewell.
299,Henry IV,61,1.2.183,POINS,"Farewell, my lord."
300,Henry IV,61,,POINS,Exit Poins
301,Henry IV,62,1.2.184,PRINCE HENRY,"I know you all, and will awhile uphold"
302,Henry IV,62,1.2.185,PRINCE HENRY,The unyoked humour of your idleness:
303,Henry IV,62,1.2.186,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet herein will I imitate the sun,"
304,Henry IV,62,1.2.187,PRINCE HENRY,Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
305,Henry IV,62,1.2.188,PRINCE HENRY,"To smother up his beauty from the world,"
306,Henry IV,62,1.2.189,PRINCE HENRY,"That, when he please again to be himself,"
307,Henry IV,62,1.2.190,PRINCE HENRY,"Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,"
308,Henry IV,62,1.2.191,PRINCE HENRY,By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
309,Henry IV,62,1.2.192,PRINCE HENRY,Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
310,Henry IV,62,1.2.193,PRINCE HENRY,"If all the year were playing holidays,"
311,Henry IV,62,1.2.194,PRINCE HENRY,"To sport would be as tedious as to work,"
312,Henry IV,62,1.2.195,PRINCE HENRY,"But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,"
313,Henry IV,62,1.2.196,PRINCE HENRY,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
314,Henry IV,62,1.2.197,PRINCE HENRY,"So, when this loose behavior I throw off"
315,Henry IV,62,1.2.198,PRINCE HENRY,"And pay the debt I never promised,"
316,Henry IV,62,1.2.199,PRINCE HENRY,"By how much better than my word I am,"
317,Henry IV,62,1.2.200,PRINCE HENRY,"By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,"
318,Henry IV,62,1.2.201,PRINCE HENRY,"And like bright metal on a sullen ground,"
319,Henry IV,62,1.2.202,PRINCE HENRY,"My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,"
320,Henry IV,62,1.2.203,PRINCE HENRY,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
321,Henry IV,62,1.2.204,PRINCE HENRY,Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
322,Henry IV,62,1.2.205,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll so offend, to make offence a skill,"
323,Henry IV,62,1.2.206,PRINCE HENRY,Redeeming time when men think least I will.
324,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit
325,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,SCENE III. London. The palace.
326,Henry IV,62,,PRINCE HENRY,"Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR, SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others"
327,Henry IV,1,1.3.1,KING HENRY IV,"My blood hath been too cold and temperate,"
328,Henry IV,1,1.3.2,KING HENRY IV,"Unapt to stir at these indignities,"
329,Henry IV,1,1.3.3,KING HENRY IV,"And you have found me, for accordingly"
330,Henry IV,1,1.3.4,KING HENRY IV,You tread upon my patience: but be sure
331,Henry IV,1,1.3.5,KING HENRY IV,"I will from henceforth rather be myself,"
332,Henry IV,1,1.3.6,KING HENRY IV,"Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition,"
333,Henry IV,1,1.3.7,KING HENRY IV,"Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,"
334,Henry IV,1,1.3.8,KING HENRY IV,And therefore lost that title of respect
335,Henry IV,1,1.3.9,KING HENRY IV,Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
336,Henry IV,2,1.3.10,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves"
337,Henry IV,2,1.3.11,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The scourge of greatness to be used on it,"
338,Henry IV,2,1.3.12,EARL OF WORCESTER,And that same greatness too which our own hands
339,Henry IV,2,1.3.13,EARL OF WORCESTER,Have holp to make so portly.
340,Henry IV,3,1.3.14,NORTHUMBERLAND,My lord.--
341,Henry IV,4,1.3.15,KING HENRY IV,"Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see"
342,Henry IV,4,1.3.16,KING HENRY IV,Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
343,Henry IV,4,1.3.17,KING HENRY IV,"O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,"
344,Henry IV,4,1.3.18,KING HENRY IV,And majesty might never yet endure
345,Henry IV,4,1.3.19,KING HENRY IV,The moody frontier of a servant brow.
346,Henry IV,4,1.3.20,KING HENRY IV,You have good leave to leave us: when we need
347,Henry IV,4,1.3.21,KING HENRY IV,"Your use and counsel, we shall send for you."
348,Henry IV,4,,KING HENRY IV,Exit Worcester
349,Henry IV,4,1.3.22,KING HENRY IV,You were about to speak.
350,Henry IV,4,,KING HENRY IV,To North
351,Henry IV,5,1.3.23,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Yea, my good lord."
352,Henry IV,5,1.3.24,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,"
353,Henry IV,5,1.3.25,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,"
354,Henry IV,5,1.3.26,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Were, as he says, not with such strength denied"
355,Henry IV,5,1.3.27,NORTHUMBERLAND,As is deliver'd to your majesty:
356,Henry IV,5,1.3.28,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Either envy, therefore, or misprison"
357,Henry IV,5,1.3.29,NORTHUMBERLAND,Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
358,Henry IV,6,1.3.30,HOTSPUR,"My liege, I did deny no prisoners."
359,Henry IV,6,1.3.31,HOTSPUR,"But I remember, when the fight was done,"
360,Henry IV,6,1.3.32,HOTSPUR,"When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,"
361,Henry IV,6,1.3.33,HOTSPUR,"Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,"
362,Henry IV,6,1.3.34,HOTSPUR,"Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,"
363,Henry IV,6,1.3.35,HOTSPUR,"Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd"
364,Henry IV,6,1.3.36,HOTSPUR,"Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home,"
365,Henry IV,6,1.3.37,HOTSPUR,"He was perfumed like a milliner,"
366,Henry IV,6,1.3.38,HOTSPUR,And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
367,Henry IV,6,1.3.39,HOTSPUR,"A pouncet-box, which ever and anon"
368,Henry IV,6,1.3.40,HOTSPUR,"He gave his nose and took't away again,"
369,Henry IV,6,1.3.41,HOTSPUR,"Who therewith angry, when it next came there,"
370,Henry IV,6,1.3.42,HOTSPUR,"Took it in snuff, and still he smiled and talk'd,"
371,Henry IV,6,1.3.43,HOTSPUR,"And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,"
372,Henry IV,6,1.3.44,HOTSPUR,"He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,"
373,Henry IV,6,1.3.45,HOTSPUR,To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
374,Henry IV,6,1.3.46,HOTSPUR,Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
375,Henry IV,6,1.3.47,HOTSPUR,With many holiday and lady terms
376,Henry IV,6,1.3.48,HOTSPUR,"He question'd me, amongst the rest, demanded"
377,Henry IV,6,1.3.49,HOTSPUR,My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
378,Henry IV,6,1.3.50,HOTSPUR,"I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,"
379,Henry IV,6,1.3.51,HOTSPUR,"To be so pester'd with a popinjay,"
380,Henry IV,6,1.3.52,HOTSPUR,"Out of my grief and my impatience,"
381,Henry IV,6,1.3.53,HOTSPUR,"Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,"
382,Henry IV,6,1.3.54,HOTSPUR,"He should or he should not, for he made me mad"
383,Henry IV,6,1.3.55,HOTSPUR,To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
384,Henry IV,6,1.3.56,HOTSPUR,And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
385,Henry IV,6,1.3.57,HOTSPUR,"Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--"
386,Henry IV,6,1.3.58,HOTSPUR,And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
387,Henry IV,6,1.3.59,HOTSPUR,"Was parmaceti for an inward bruise,"
388,Henry IV,6,1.3.60,HOTSPUR,"And that it was great pity, so it was,"
389,Henry IV,6,1.3.61,HOTSPUR,This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
390,Henry IV,6,1.3.62,HOTSPUR,"Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,"
391,Henry IV,6,1.3.63,HOTSPUR,Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
392,Henry IV,6,1.3.64,HOTSPUR,"So cowardly, and but for these vile guns,"
393,Henry IV,6,1.3.65,HOTSPUR,He would himself have been a soldier.
394,Henry IV,6,1.3.66,HOTSPUR,"This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,"
395,Henry IV,6,1.3.67,HOTSPUR,"I answer'd indirectly, as I said,"
396,Henry IV,6,1.3.68,HOTSPUR,"And I beseech you, let not his report"
397,Henry IV,6,1.3.69,HOTSPUR,Come current for an accusation
398,Henry IV,6,1.3.70,HOTSPUR,Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
399,Henry IV,7,1.3.71,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,"
400,Henry IV,7,1.3.72,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
401,Henry IV,7,1.3.73,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"To such a person and in such a place,"
402,Henry IV,7,1.3.74,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"At such a time, with all the rest retold,"
403,Henry IV,7,1.3.75,SIR WALTER BLUNT,May reasonably die and never rise
404,Henry IV,7,1.3.76,SIR WALTER BLUNT,To do him wrong or any way impeach
405,Henry IV,7,1.3.77,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What then he said, so he unsay it now."
406,Henry IV,8,1.3.78,KING HENRY IV,"Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,"
407,Henry IV,8,1.3.79,KING HENRY IV,"But with proviso and exception,"
408,Henry IV,8,1.3.80,KING HENRY IV,That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
409,Henry IV,8,1.3.81,KING HENRY IV,"His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,"
410,Henry IV,8,1.3.82,KING HENRY IV,"Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd"
411,Henry IV,8,1.3.83,KING HENRY IV,The lives of those that he did lead to fight
412,Henry IV,8,1.3.84,KING HENRY IV,"Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,"
413,Henry IV,8,1.3.85,KING HENRY IV,"Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March"
414,Henry IV,8,1.3.86,KING HENRY IV,"Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,"
415,Henry IV,8,1.3.87,KING HENRY IV,Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
416,Henry IV,8,1.3.88,KING HENRY IV,"Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,"
417,Henry IV,8,1.3.89,KING HENRY IV,When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
418,Henry IV,8,1.3.90,KING HENRY IV,"No, on the barren mountains let him starve,"
419,Henry IV,8,1.3.91,KING HENRY IV,For I shall never hold that man my friend
420,Henry IV,8,1.3.92,KING HENRY IV,Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
421,Henry IV,8,1.3.93,KING HENRY IV,To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
422,Henry IV,9,1.3.94,HOTSPUR,Revolted Mortimer!
423,Henry IV,9,1.3.95,HOTSPUR,"He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,"
424,Henry IV,9,1.3.96,HOTSPUR,"But by the chance of war, to prove that true"
425,Henry IV,9,1.3.97,HOTSPUR,"Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,"
426,Henry IV,9,1.3.98,HOTSPUR,"Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took"
427,Henry IV,9,1.3.99,HOTSPUR,"When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,"
428,Henry IV,9,1.3.100,HOTSPUR,"In single opposition, hand to hand,"
429,Henry IV,9,1.3.101,HOTSPUR,He did confound the best part of an hour
430,Henry IV,9,1.3.102,HOTSPUR,In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
431,Henry IV,9,1.3.103,HOTSPUR,Three times they breathed and three times did
432,Henry IV,9,1.3.104,HOTSPUR,"they drink,"
433,Henry IV,9,1.3.105,HOTSPUR,"Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,"
434,Henry IV,9,1.3.106,HOTSPUR,"Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,"
435,Henry IV,9,1.3.107,HOTSPUR,"Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,"
436,Henry IV,9,1.3.108,HOTSPUR,"And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,"
437,Henry IV,9,1.3.109,HOTSPUR,Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
438,Henry IV,9,1.3.110,HOTSPUR,Never did base and rotten policy
439,Henry IV,9,1.3.111,HOTSPUR,"Colour her working with such deadly wounds,"
440,Henry IV,9,1.3.112,HOTSPUR,Nor could the noble Mortimer
441,Henry IV,9,1.3.113,HOTSPUR,"Receive so many, and all willingly:"
442,Henry IV,9,1.3.114,HOTSPUR,Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
443,Henry IV,10,1.3.115,KING HENRY IV,"Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him,"
444,Henry IV,10,1.3.116,KING HENRY IV,He never did encounter with Glendower:
445,Henry IV,10,1.3.117,KING HENRY IV,"I tell thee,"
446,Henry IV,10,1.3.118,KING HENRY IV,He durst as well have met the devil alone
447,Henry IV,10,1.3.119,KING HENRY IV,As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
448,Henry IV,10,1.3.120,KING HENRY IV,"Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth"
449,Henry IV,10,1.3.121,KING HENRY IV,Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
450,Henry IV,10,1.3.122,KING HENRY IV,"Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,"
451,Henry IV,10,1.3.123,KING HENRY IV,Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
452,Henry IV,10,1.3.124,KING HENRY IV,"As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,"
453,Henry IV,10,1.3.125,KING HENRY IV,We licence your departure with your son.
454,Henry IV,10,1.3.126,KING HENRY IV,"Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it."
455,Henry IV,10,,KING HENRY IV,"Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train"
456,Henry IV,11,1.3.127,HOTSPUR,"An if the devil come and roar for them,"
457,Henry IV,11,1.3.128,HOTSPUR,I will not send them: I will after straight
458,Henry IV,11,1.3.129,HOTSPUR,"And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,"
459,Henry IV,11,1.3.130,HOTSPUR,Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
460,Henry IV,12,1.3.131,NORTHUMBERLAND,"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:"
461,Henry IV,12,1.3.132,NORTHUMBERLAND,Here comes your uncle.
462,Henry IV,12,,NORTHUMBERLAND,Re-enter WORCESTER
463,Henry IV,13,1.3.133,HOTSPUR,Speak of Mortimer!
464,Henry IV,13,1.3.134,HOTSPUR,"'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul"
465,Henry IV,13,1.3.135,HOTSPUR,"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:"
466,Henry IV,13,1.3.136,HOTSPUR,"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
467,Henry IV,13,1.3.137,HOTSPUR,"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
468,Henry IV,13,1.3.138,HOTSPUR,But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
469,Henry IV,13,1.3.139,HOTSPUR,"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
470,Henry IV,13,1.3.140,HOTSPUR,As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
471,Henry IV,14,1.3.141,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
472,Henry IV,15,1.3.142,EARL OF WORCESTER,Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
473,Henry IV,16,1.3.143,HOTSPUR,"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,"
474,Henry IV,16,1.3.144,HOTSPUR,And when I urged the ransom once again
475,Henry IV,16,1.3.145,HOTSPUR,"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
476,Henry IV,16,1.3.146,HOTSPUR,"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
477,Henry IV,16,1.3.147,HOTSPUR,Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
478,Henry IV,17,1.3.148,EARL OF WORCESTER,I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
479,Henry IV,17,1.3.149,EARL OF WORCESTER,By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
480,Henry IV,18,1.3.150,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He was, I heard the proclamation:"
481,Henry IV,18,1.3.151,NORTHUMBERLAND,"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
482,Henry IV,18,1.3.152,NORTHUMBERLAND,--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
483,Henry IV,18,1.3.153,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Upon his Irish expedition,"
484,Henry IV,18,1.3.154,NORTHUMBERLAND,From whence he intercepted did return
485,Henry IV,18,1.3.155,NORTHUMBERLAND,To be deposed and shortly murdered.
486,Henry IV,19,1.3.156,EARL OF WORCESTER,And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
487,Henry IV,19,1.3.157,EARL OF WORCESTER,Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
488,Henry IV,20,1.3.158,HOTSPUR,"But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then"
489,Henry IV,20,1.3.159,HOTSPUR,Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
490,Henry IV,20,1.3.160,HOTSPUR,Heir to the crown?
491,Henry IV,21,1.3.161,NORTHUMBERLAND,"He did, myself did hear it."
492,Henry IV,22,1.3.162,HOTSPUR,"Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,"
493,Henry IV,22,1.3.163,HOTSPUR,That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
494,Henry IV,22,1.3.164,HOTSPUR,"But shall it be that you, that set the crown"
495,Henry IV,22,1.3.165,HOTSPUR,Upon the head of this forgetful man
496,Henry IV,22,1.3.166,HOTSPUR,And for his sake wear the detested blot
497,Henry IV,22,1.3.167,HOTSPUR,"Of murderous subornation, shall it be,"
498,Henry IV,22,1.3.168,HOTSPUR,"That you a world of curses undergo,"
499,Henry IV,22,1.3.169,HOTSPUR,"Being the agents, or base second means,"
500,Henry IV,22,1.3.170,HOTSPUR,"The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?"
501,Henry IV,22,1.3.171,HOTSPUR,"O, pardon me that I descend so low,"
502,Henry IV,22,1.3.172,HOTSPUR,To show the line and the predicament
503,Henry IV,22,1.3.173,HOTSPUR,"Wherein you range under this subtle king,"
504,Henry IV,22,1.3.174,HOTSPUR,"Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,"
505,Henry IV,22,1.3.175,HOTSPUR,"Or fill up chronicles in time to come,"
506,Henry IV,22,1.3.176,HOTSPUR,That men of your nobility and power
507,Henry IV,22,1.3.177,HOTSPUR,"Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,"
508,Henry IV,22,1.3.178,HOTSPUR,"As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,"
509,Henry IV,22,1.3.179,HOTSPUR,"To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,"
510,Henry IV,22,1.3.180,HOTSPUR,"An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?"
511,Henry IV,22,1.3.181,HOTSPUR,"And shall it in more shame be further spoken,"
512,Henry IV,22,1.3.182,HOTSPUR,"That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off"
513,Henry IV,22,1.3.183,HOTSPUR,By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
514,Henry IV,22,1.3.184,HOTSPUR,"No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem"
515,Henry IV,22,1.3.185,HOTSPUR,Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
516,Henry IV,22,1.3.186,HOTSPUR,"Into the good thoughts of the world again,"
517,Henry IV,22,1.3.187,HOTSPUR,Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
518,Henry IV,22,1.3.188,HOTSPUR,"Of this proud king, who studies day and night"
519,Henry IV,22,1.3.189,HOTSPUR,To answer all the debt he owes to you
520,Henry IV,22,1.3.190,HOTSPUR,Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
521,Henry IV,22,1.3.191,HOTSPUR,"Therefore, I say--"
522,Henry IV,23,1.3.192,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Peace, cousin, say no more:"
523,Henry IV,23,1.3.193,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And now I will unclasp a secret book,"
524,Henry IV,23,1.3.194,EARL OF WORCESTER,And to your quick-conceiving discontents
525,Henry IV,23,1.3.195,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,"
526,Henry IV,23,1.3.196,EARL OF WORCESTER,As full of peril and adventurous spirit
527,Henry IV,23,1.3.197,EARL OF WORCESTER,As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
528,Henry IV,23,1.3.198,EARL OF WORCESTER,On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
529,Henry IV,24,1.3.199,HOTSPUR,"If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:"
530,Henry IV,24,1.3.200,HOTSPUR,"Send danger from the east unto the west,"
531,Henry IV,24,1.3.201,HOTSPUR,"So honour cross it from the north to south,"
532,Henry IV,24,1.3.202,HOTSPUR,"And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs"
533,Henry IV,24,1.3.203,HOTSPUR,To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
534,Henry IV,25,1.3.204,NORTHUMBERLAND,Imagination of some great exploit
535,Henry IV,25,1.3.205,NORTHUMBERLAND,Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
536,Henry IV,26,1.3.206,HOTSPUR,"By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,"
537,Henry IV,26,1.3.207,HOTSPUR,"To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,"
538,Henry IV,26,1.3.208,HOTSPUR,"Or dive into the bottom of the deep,"
539,Henry IV,26,1.3.209,HOTSPUR,"Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,"
540,Henry IV,26,1.3.210,HOTSPUR,"And pluck up drowned honour by the locks,"
541,Henry IV,26,1.3.211,HOTSPUR,So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
542,Henry IV,26,1.3.212,HOTSPUR,"Without corrival, all her dignities:"
543,Henry IV,26,1.3.213,HOTSPUR,But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
544,Henry IV,27,1.3.214,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He apprehends a world of figures here,"
545,Henry IV,27,1.3.215,EARL OF WORCESTER,But not the form of what he should attend.
546,Henry IV,27,1.3.216,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, give me audience for a while."
547,Henry IV,28,1.3.217,HOTSPUR,I cry you mercy.
548,Henry IV,29,1.3.218,EARL OF WORCESTER,Those same noble Scots
549,Henry IV,29,1.3.219,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That are your prisoners,--"
550,Henry IV,30,1.3.220,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them all,"
551,Henry IV,30,1.3.221,HOTSPUR,"By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,"
552,Henry IV,30,1.3.222,HOTSPUR,"No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:"
553,Henry IV,30,1.3.223,HOTSPUR,"I'll keep them, by this hand."
554,Henry IV,31,1.3.224,EARL OF WORCESTER,You start away
555,Henry IV,31,1.3.225,EARL OF WORCESTER,And lend no ear unto my purposes.
556,Henry IV,31,1.3.226,EARL OF WORCESTER,Those prisoners you shall keep.
557,Henry IV,32,1.3.227,HOTSPUR,"Nay, I will, that's flat:"
558,Henry IV,32,1.3.228,HOTSPUR,"He said he would not ransom Mortimer,"
559,Henry IV,32,1.3.229,HOTSPUR,"Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer,"
560,Henry IV,32,1.3.230,HOTSPUR,"But I will find him when he lies asleep,"
561,Henry IV,32,1.3.231,HOTSPUR,And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
562,Henry IV,32,1.3.232,HOTSPUR,"Nay,"
563,Henry IV,32,1.3.233,HOTSPUR,I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
564,Henry IV,32,1.3.234,HOTSPUR,"Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him"
565,Henry IV,32,1.3.235,HOTSPUR,To keep his anger still in motion.
566,Henry IV,33,1.3.236,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear you, cousin, a word."
567,Henry IV,34,1.3.237,HOTSPUR,"All studies here I solemnly defy,"
568,Henry IV,34,1.3.238,HOTSPUR,Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
569,Henry IV,34,1.3.239,HOTSPUR,"And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,"
570,Henry IV,34,1.3.240,HOTSPUR,But that I think his father loves him not
571,Henry IV,34,1.3.241,HOTSPUR,"And would be glad he met with some mischance,"
572,Henry IV,34,1.3.242,HOTSPUR,I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
573,Henry IV,35,1.3.243,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you"
574,Henry IV,35,1.3.244,EARL OF WORCESTER,When you are better temper'd to attend.
575,Henry IV,36,1.3.245,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool"
576,Henry IV,36,1.3.246,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Art thou to break into this woman's mood,"
577,Henry IV,36,1.3.247,NORTHUMBERLAND,Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
578,Henry IV,37,1.3.248,HOTSPUR,"Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,"
579,Henry IV,37,1.3.249,HOTSPUR,"Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear"
580,Henry IV,37,1.3.250,HOTSPUR,"Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."
581,Henry IV,37,1.3.251,HOTSPUR,"In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--"
582,Henry IV,37,1.3.252,HOTSPUR,"A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire,"
583,Henry IV,37,1.3.253,HOTSPUR,"'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,"
584,Henry IV,37,1.3.254,HOTSPUR,"His uncle York, where I first bow'd my knee"
585,Henry IV,37,1.3.255,HOTSPUR,"Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--"
586,Henry IV,37,1.3.256,HOTSPUR,'Sblood!--
587,Henry IV,37,1.3.257,HOTSPUR,When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
588,Henry IV,38,1.3.258,NORTHUMBERLAND,At Berkley castle.
589,Henry IV,39,1.3.259,HOTSPUR,You say true:
590,Henry IV,39,1.3.260,HOTSPUR,"Why, what a candy deal of courtesy"
591,Henry IV,39,1.3.261,HOTSPUR,This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
592,Henry IV,39,1.3.262,HOTSPUR,"Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'"
593,Henry IV,39,1.3.263,HOTSPUR,"And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin,'"
594,Henry IV,39,1.3.264,HOTSPUR,"O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!"
595,Henry IV,39,1.3.265,HOTSPUR,"Good uncle, tell your tale, I have done."
596,Henry IV,40,1.3.266,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nay, if you have not, to it again,"
597,Henry IV,40,1.3.267,EARL OF WORCESTER,We will stay your leisure.
598,Henry IV,41,1.3.268,HOTSPUR,"I have done, i' faith."
599,Henry IV,42,1.3.269,EARL OF WORCESTER,Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
600,Henry IV,42,1.3.270,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Deliver them up without their ransom straight,"
601,Henry IV,42,1.3.271,EARL OF WORCESTER,And make the Douglas' son your only mean
602,Henry IV,42,1.3.272,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For powers in Scotland, which, for divers reasons"
603,Henry IV,42,1.3.273,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Which I shall send you written, be assured,"
604,Henry IV,42,1.3.274,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Will easily be granted. You, my lord,"
605,Henry IV,42,,EARL OF WORCESTER,To Northumberland
606,Henry IV,42,1.3.275,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,"
607,Henry IV,42,1.3.276,EARL OF WORCESTER,Shall secretly into the bosom creep
608,Henry IV,42,1.3.277,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,"
609,Henry IV,42,1.3.278,EARL OF WORCESTER,The archbishop.
610,Henry IV,43,1.3.279,HOTSPUR,"Of York, is it not?"
611,Henry IV,44,1.3.280,EARL OF WORCESTER,"True, who bears hard"
612,Henry IV,44,1.3.281,EARL OF WORCESTER,"His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop."
613,Henry IV,44,1.3.282,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I speak not this in estimation,"
614,Henry IV,44,1.3.283,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As what I think might be, but what I know"
615,Henry IV,44,1.3.284,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Is ruminated, plotted and set down,"
616,Henry IV,44,1.3.285,EARL OF WORCESTER,And only stays but to behold the face
617,Henry IV,44,1.3.286,EARL OF WORCESTER,Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
618,Henry IV,45,1.3.287,HOTSPUR,"I smell it: upon my life, it will do well."
619,Henry IV,46,1.3.288,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip."
620,Henry IV,47,1.3.289,HOTSPUR,"Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot,"
621,Henry IV,47,1.3.290,HOTSPUR,"And then the power of Scotland and of York,"
622,Henry IV,47,1.3.291,HOTSPUR,"To join with Mortimer, ha?"
623,Henry IV,48,1.3.292,EARL OF WORCESTER,And so they shall.
624,Henry IV,49,1.3.293,HOTSPUR,"In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd."
625,Henry IV,50,1.3.294,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,"
626,Henry IV,50,1.3.295,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To save our heads by raising of a head,"
627,Henry IV,50,1.3.296,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For, bear ourselves as even as we can,"
628,Henry IV,50,1.3.297,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king will always think him in our debt,"
629,Henry IV,50,1.3.298,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,"
630,Henry IV,50,1.3.299,EARL OF WORCESTER,Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
631,Henry IV,50,1.3.300,EARL OF WORCESTER,And see already how he doth begin
632,Henry IV,50,1.3.301,EARL OF WORCESTER,To make us strangers to his looks of love.
633,Henry IV,51,1.3.302,HOTSPUR,"He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him."
634,Henry IV,52,1.3.303,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Cousin, farewell: no further go in this"
635,Henry IV,52,1.3.304,EARL OF WORCESTER,Than I by letters shall direct your course.
636,Henry IV,52,1.3.305,EARL OF WORCESTER,"When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,"
637,Henry IV,52,1.3.306,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,"
638,Henry IV,52,1.3.307,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,"
639,Henry IV,52,1.3.308,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,"
640,Henry IV,52,1.3.309,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,"
641,Henry IV,52,1.3.310,EARL OF WORCESTER,Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
642,Henry IV,53,1.3.311,NORTHUMBERLAND,"Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust."
643,Henry IV,54,1.3.312,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short"
644,Henry IV,54,1.3.313,HOTSPUR,Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!
645,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,Exeunt
646,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,ACT II
647,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,SCENE I. Rochester. An inn yard.
648,Henry IV,54,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand
649,Henry IV,1,2.1.1,First Carrier,"Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be"
650,Henry IV,1,2.1.2,First Carrier,"hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and"
651,Henry IV,1,2.1.3,First Carrier,"yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!"
652,Henry IV,2,2.1.4,Ostler,"[Within]   Anon, anon."
653,Henry IV,3,2.1.5,First Carrier,"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks"
654,Henry IV,3,2.1.6,First Carrier,"in the point, poor jade, is wrung in the withers out"
655,Henry IV,3,2.1.7,First Carrier,of all cess.
656,Henry IV,3,,First Carrier,Enter another Carrier
657,Henry IV,4,2.1.8,Second Carrier,"Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that"
658,Henry IV,4,2.1.9,Second Carrier,is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
659,Henry IV,4,2.1.10,Second Carrier,house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
660,Henry IV,5,2.1.11,First Carrier,"Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats"
661,Henry IV,5,2.1.12,First Carrier,"rose, it was the death of him."
662,Henry IV,6,2.1.13,Second Carrier,I think this be the most villanous house in all
663,Henry IV,6,2.1.14,Second Carrier,London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
664,Henry IV,7,2.1.15,First Carrier,"Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king"
665,Henry IV,7,2.1.16,First Carrier,christen could be better bit than I have been since
666,Henry IV,7,2.1.17,First Carrier,the first cock.
667,Henry IV,8,2.1.18,Second Carrier,"Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we"
668,Henry IV,8,2.1.19,Second Carrier,"leak in your chimney, and your chamber-lie breeds"
669,Henry IV,8,2.1.20,Second Carrier,fleas like a loach.
670,Henry IV,9,2.1.21,First Carrier,"What, ostler! come away and be hanged!"
671,Henry IV,10,2.1.22,Second Carrier,"I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,"
672,Henry IV,10,2.1.23,Second Carrier,to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
673,Henry IV,11,2.1.24,First Carrier,God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
674,Henry IV,11,2.1.25,First Carrier,"starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou"
675,Henry IV,11,2.1.26,First Carrier,never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An

677,Henry IV,11,2.1.28,First Carrier,"on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!"
678,Henry IV,11,2.1.29,First Carrier,hast thou no faith in thee?
679,Henry IV,11,,First Carrier,Enter GADSHILL
680,Henry IV,12,2.1.30,GADSHILL,"Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?"
681,Henry IV,13,2.1.31,First Carrier,I think it be two o'clock.
682,Henry IV,14,2.1.32,GADSHILL,"I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding"
683,Henry IV,14,2.1.33,GADSHILL,in the stable.
684,Henry IV,15,2.1.34,First Carrier,"Nay, by God, soft, I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith."
685,Henry IV,16,2.1.35,GADSHILL,"I pray thee, lend me thine."
686,Henry IV,17,2.1.36,Second Carrier,"Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth"
687,Henry IV,17,2.1.37,Second Carrier,"he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first."
688,Henry IV,18,2.1.38,GADSHILL,"Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?"
689,Henry IV,19,2.1.39,Second Carrier,"Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant"
690,Henry IV,19,2.1.40,Second Carrier,"thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the"
691,Henry IV,19,2.1.41,Second Carrier,"gentleman: they will along with company, for they"
692,Henry IV,19,2.1.42,Second Carrier,have great charge.
693,Henry IV,19,,Second Carrier,Exeunt carriers
694,Henry IV,20,2.1.43,GADSHILL,"What, ho! chamberlain!"
695,Henry IV,21,2.1.44,Chamberlain,"[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse."
696,Henry IV,22,2.1.45,GADSHILL,"That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the"
697,Henry IV,22,2.1.46,GADSHILL,"chamberlain, for thou variest no more from picking"
698,Henry IV,22,2.1.47,GADSHILL,"of purses than giving direction doth from labouring,"
699,Henry IV,22,2.1.48,GADSHILL,thou layest the plot how.
700,Henry IV,22,,GADSHILL,Enter Chamberlain
701,Henry IV,23,2.1.49,Chamberlain,"Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that"
702,Henry IV,23,2.1.50,Chamberlain,I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
703,Henry IV,23,2.1.51,Chamberlain,wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
704,Henry IV,23,2.1.52,Chamberlain,him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
705,Henry IV,23,2.1.53,Chamberlain,"company last night at supper, a kind of auditor, one"
706,Henry IV,23,2.1.54,Chamberlain,"that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what."
707,Henry IV,23,2.1.55,Chamberlain,"They are up already, and call for eggs and butter,"
708,Henry IV,23,2.1.56,Chamberlain,they will away presently.
709,Henry IV,24,2.1.57,GADSHILL,"Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'"
710,Henry IV,24,2.1.58,GADSHILL,"clerks, I'll give thee this neck."
711,Henry IV,25,2.1.59,Chamberlain,"No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the"
712,Henry IV,25,2.1.60,Chamberlain,"hangman, for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas"
713,Henry IV,25,2.1.61,Chamberlain,as truly as a man of falsehood may.
714,Henry IV,26,2.1.62,GADSHILL,"What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,"
715,Henry IV,26,2.1.63,GADSHILL,"I'll make a fat pair of gallows, for if I hang, old"
716,Henry IV,26,2.1.64,GADSHILL,"Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no"

723,Henry IV,26,2.1.71,GADSHILL,"none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms,"
724,Henry IV,26,2.1.72,GADSHILL,"but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and"

726,Henry IV,26,2.1.74,GADSHILL,"strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than"

731,Henry IV,26,2.1.79,GADSHILL,her their boots.
732,Henry IV,27,2.1.80,Chamberlain,"What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold"
733,Henry IV,27,2.1.81,Chamberlain,out water in foul way?
734,Henry IV,28,2.1.82,GADSHILL,"She will, she will, justice hath liquored her. We"

738,Henry IV,29,2.1.86,Chamberlain,the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
739,Henry IV,30,2.1.87,GADSHILL,Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
740,Henry IV,30,2.1.88,GADSHILL,"purchase, as I am a true man."
741,Henry IV,31,2.1.89,Chamberlain,"Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief."
742,Henry IV,32,2.1.90,GADSHILL,"Go to, 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the"

754,Henry IV,4,2.2.6,PRINCE HENRY,thou keep!
755,Henry IV,5,2.2.7,FALSTAFF,"Where's Poins, Hal?"
756,Henry IV,6,2.2.8,PRINCE HENRY,He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
757,Henry IV,7,2.2.9,FALSTAFF,I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
758,Henry IV,7,2.2.10,FALSTAFF,"rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know"
759,Henry IV,7,2.2.11,FALSTAFF,not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
760,Henry IV,7,2.2.12,FALSTAFF,"further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt"
761,Henry IV,7,2.2.13,FALSTAFF,"not but to die a fair death for all this, if I"

764,Henry IV,7,2.2.16,FALSTAFF,"twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the"
765,Henry IV,7,2.2.17,FALSTAFF,rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
766,Henry IV,7,2.2.18,FALSTAFF,"medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged, it"
767,Henry IV,7,2.2.19,FALSTAFF,could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
768,Henry IV,7,2.2.20,FALSTAFF,Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
769,Henry IV,7,2.2.21,FALSTAFF,I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere

771,Henry IV,7,2.2.23,FALSTAFF,"leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that"
772,Henry IV,7,2.2.24,FALSTAFF,ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven

774,Henry IV,7,2.2.26,FALSTAFF,and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
775,Henry IV,7,2.2.27,FALSTAFF,a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!

781,Henry IV,8,2.2.32,PRINCE HENRY,of travellers.
782,Henry IV,9,2.2.33,FALSTAFF,"Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?"
783,Henry IV,9,2.2.34,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot"
784,Henry IV,9,2.2.35,FALSTAFF,again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
785,Henry IV,9,2.2.36,FALSTAFF,What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
786,Henry IV,10,2.2.37,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou liest, thou art not colted, thou art uncolted."

791,Henry IV,13,2.2.42,FALSTAFF,"garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I"

802,Henry IV,17,2.2.52,BARDOLPH,to the king's exchequer.
803,Henry IV,18,2.2.53,FALSTAFF,"You lie, ye rogue, 'tis going to the king's tavern."

810,Henry IV,23,2.2.60,GADSHILL,Some eight or ten.
811,Henry IV,24,2.2.61,FALSTAFF,"'Zounds, will they not rob us?"
812,Henry IV,25,2.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,"What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?"
813,Henry IV,26,2.2.63,FALSTAFF,"Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,"
814,Henry IV,26,2.2.64,FALSTAFF,"but yet no coward, Hal."
815,Henry IV,27,2.2.65,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, we leave that to the proof."
816,Henry IV,28,2.2.66,POINS,"Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:"
817,Henry IV,28,2.2.67,POINS,"when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him."
818,Henry IV,28,2.2.68,POINS,"Farewell, and stand fast."

827,Henry IV,33,2.2.75,First Traveller,"the hill, we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs."
828,Henry IV,34,2.2.76,Thieves,Stand!
829,Henry IV,35,2.2.77,Travellers,Jesus bless us!
830,Henry IV,36,2.2.78,FALSTAFF,"Strike, down with them, cut the villains' throats:"

837,Henry IV,38,2.2.85,FALSTAFF,"You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith."

839,Henry IV,38,,FALSTAFF,Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
840,Henry IV,39,2.2.86,PRINCE HENRY,The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
841,Henry IV,39,2.2.87,PRINCE HENRY,"and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it"
842,Henry IV,39,2.2.88,PRINCE HENRY,"would be argument for a week, laughter for a month"
843,Henry IV,39,2.2.89,PRINCE HENRY,and a good jest for ever.
844,Henry IV,40,2.2.90,POINS,"Stand close, I hear them coming."
845,Henry IV,40,,POINS,Enter the Thieves again
846,Henry IV,41,2.2.91,FALSTAFF,"Come, my masters, let us share, and then to  horse"
847,Henry IV,41,2.2.92,FALSTAFF,before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
848,Henry IV,41,2.2.93,FALSTAFF,"arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's"
849,Henry IV,41,2.2.94,FALSTAFF,no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
850,Henry IV,42,2.2.95,PRINCE HENRY,Your money!
851,Henry IV,43,2.2.96,POINS,Villains!
852,Henry IV,43,2.2.96,POINS,"As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon  them, they all run away, and Falstaff, after a blow or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them"
853,Henry IV,44,2.2.97,PRINCE HENRY,Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
854,Henry IV,44,2.2.98,PRINCE HENRY,The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
855,Henry IV,44,2.2.99,PRINCE HENRY,"So strongly that they dare not meet each other,"
856,Henry IV,44,2.2.100,PRINCE HENRY,Each takes his fellow for an officer.
857,Henry IV,44,2.2.101,PRINCE HENRY,"Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,"
858,Henry IV,44,2.2.102,PRINCE HENRY,And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
859,Henry IV,44,2.2.103,PRINCE HENRY,"Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him."
860,Henry IV,45,2.2.104,POINS,How the rogue roar'd!

865,Henry IV,1,2.3.2,HOTSPUR,"contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear"
866,Henry IV,1,2.3.3,HOTSPUR,"your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,"
867,Henry IV,1,2.3.4,HOTSPUR,then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
868,Henry IV,1,2.3.5,HOTSPUR,"he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than"
869,Henry IV,1,2.3.6,HOTSPUR,he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
870,Henry IV,1,2.3.7,HOTSPUR,"purpose you undertake is dangerous,'--why, that's"
871,Henry IV,1,2.3.8,HOTSPUR,"certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to"
872,Henry IV,1,2.3.9,HOTSPUR,"drink, but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this"
873,Henry IV,1,2.3.10,HOTSPUR,"nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The"
874,Henry IV,1,2.3.11,HOTSPUR,"purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you"
875,Henry IV,1,2.3.12,HOTSPUR,"have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and"
876,Henry IV,1,2.3.13,HOTSPUR,your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
877,Henry IV,1,2.3.14,HOTSPUR,"great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say"
878,Henry IV,1,2.3.15,HOTSPUR,"unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and"
879,Henry IV,1,2.3.16,HOTSPUR,"you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,"

882,Henry IV,1,2.3.19,HOTSPUR,"friends, and full of expectation, an excellent plot,"
883,Henry IV,1,2.3.20,HOTSPUR,very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
884,Henry IV,1,2.3.21,HOTSPUR,"this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the"
885,Henry IV,1,2.3.22,HOTSPUR,"general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by"
886,Henry IV,1,2.3.23,HOTSPUR,"this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan."
887,Henry IV,1,2.3.24,HOTSPUR,"Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord"

891,Henry IV,1,2.3.28,HOTSPUR,next month? and are they not some of them set
892,Henry IV,1,2.3.29,HOTSPUR,forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
893,Henry IV,1,2.3.30,HOTSPUR,infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
894,Henry IV,1,2.3.31,HOTSPUR,"of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay"
895,Henry IV,1,2.3.32,HOTSPUR,"open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself"
896,Henry IV,1,2.3.33,HOTSPUR,"and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of"
897,Henry IV,1,2.3.34,HOTSPUR,skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
898,Henry IV,1,2.3.35,HOTSPUR,let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
899,Henry IV,1,2.3.36,HOTSPUR,forward to-night.

902,Henry IV,2,2.3.38,LADY PERCY,"O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?"
903,Henry IV,2,2.3.39,LADY PERCY,For what offence have I this fortnight been
904,Henry IV,2,2.3.40,LADY PERCY,A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
905,Henry IV,2,2.3.41,LADY PERCY,"Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee"
906,Henry IV,2,2.3.42,LADY PERCY,"Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?"
907,Henry IV,2,2.3.43,LADY PERCY,"Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,"
908,Henry IV,2,2.3.44,LADY PERCY,And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
909,Henry IV,2,2.3.45,LADY PERCY,"Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks,"
910,Henry IV,2,2.3.46,LADY PERCY,And given my treasures and my rights of thee
911,Henry IV,2,2.3.47,LADY PERCY,To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
912,Henry IV,2,2.3.48,LADY PERCY,"In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,"
913,Henry IV,2,2.3.49,LADY PERCY,"And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,"
914,Henry IV,2,2.3.50,LADY PERCY,"Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,"
915,Henry IV,2,2.3.51,LADY PERCY,Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
916,Henry IV,2,2.3.52,LADY PERCY,"Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,"
917,Henry IV,2,2.3.53,LADY PERCY,"Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,"
918,Henry IV,2,2.3.54,LADY PERCY,"Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,"
919,Henry IV,2,2.3.55,LADY PERCY,"Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,"
920,Henry IV,2,2.3.56,LADY PERCY,And all the currents of a heady fight.
921,Henry IV,2,2.3.57,LADY PERCY,Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
922,Henry IV,2,2.3.58,LADY PERCY,"And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,"
923,Henry IV,2,2.3.59,LADY PERCY,That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
924,Henry IV,2,2.3.60,LADY PERCY,"Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream,"
925,Henry IV,2,2.3.61,LADY PERCY,"And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,"
926,Henry IV,2,2.3.62,LADY PERCY,Such as we see when men restrain their breath
927,Henry IV,2,2.3.63,LADY PERCY,"On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?"
928,Henry IV,2,2.3.64,LADY PERCY,"Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,"
929,Henry IV,2,2.3.65,LADY PERCY,"And I must know it, else he loves me not."

936,Henry IV,7,2.3.71,HOTSPUR,"What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?"
937,Henry IV,8,2.3.72,Servant,"It is, my lord."
938,Henry IV,9,2.3.73,HOTSPUR,That roan shall by my throne.

944,Henry IV,12,2.3.78,LADY PERCY,What is it carries you away?
945,Henry IV,13,2.3.79,HOTSPUR,"Why, my horse, my love, my horse."
946,Henry IV,14,2.3.80,LADY PERCY,"Out, you mad-headed ape!"
947,Henry IV,14,2.3.81,LADY PERCY,A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
948,Henry IV,14,2.3.82,LADY PERCY,"As you are toss'd with. In faith,"
949,Henry IV,14,2.3.83,LADY PERCY,"I'll know your business, Harry, that I will."
950,Henry IV,14,2.3.84,LADY PERCY,I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
951,Henry IV,14,2.3.85,LADY PERCY,"About his title, and hath sent for you"
952,Henry IV,14,2.3.86,LADY PERCY,"To line his enterprise: but if you go,--"
953,Henry IV,15,2.3.87,HOTSPUR,"So far afoot, I shall be weary, love."
954,Henry IV,16,2.3.88,LADY PERCY,"Come, come, you paraquito, answer me"
955,Henry IV,16,2.3.89,LADY PERCY,Directly unto this question that I ask:
956,Henry IV,16,2.3.90,LADY PERCY,"In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,"
957,Henry IV,16,2.3.91,LADY PERCY,An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.

967,Henry IV,18,2.3.101,LADY PERCY,"Well, do not then, for since you love me not,"
968,Henry IV,18,2.3.102,LADY PERCY,I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
969,Henry IV,18,2.3.103,LADY PERCY,"Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no."

984,Henry IV,21,2.3.118,HOTSPUR,"Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:"

994,Henry IV,2,2.4.3,POINS,"Where hast been, Hal?"
995,Henry IV,3,2.4.4,PRINCE HENRY,With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
996,Henry IV,3,2.4.5,PRINCE HENRY,score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
997,Henry IV,3,2.4.6,PRINCE HENRY,"base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother"
998,Henry IV,3,2.4.7,PRINCE HENRY,"to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by"
999,Henry IV,3,2.4.8,PRINCE HENRY,"their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis."
1000,Henry IV,3,2.4.9,PRINCE HENRY,"They take it already upon their salvation, that"

1004,Henry IV,3,2.4.13,PRINCE HENRY,"good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I"
1005,Henry IV,3,2.4.14,PRINCE HENRY,"am king of England, I shall command all the good"
1006,Henry IV,3,2.4.15,PRINCE HENRY,"lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing"
1007,Henry IV,3,2.4.16,PRINCE HENRY,"scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they"
1008,Henry IV,3,2.4.17,PRINCE HENRY,"cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I"
1009,Henry IV,3,2.4.18,PRINCE HENRY,"am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,"
1010,Henry IV,3,2.4.19,PRINCE HENRY,that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
1011,Henry IV,3,2.4.20,PRINCE HENRY,"during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost"
1012,Henry IV,3,2.4.21,PRINCE HENRY,"much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet"
1013,Henry IV,3,2.4.22,PRINCE HENRY,"action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of"
1014,Henry IV,3,2.4.23,PRINCE HENRY,"Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped"
1015,Henry IV,3,2.4.24,PRINCE HENRY,"even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that"

1019,Henry IV,3,2.4.28,PRINCE HENRY,"of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to"
1020,Henry IV,3,2.4.29,PRINCE HENRY,"drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,"
1021,Henry IV,3,2.4.30,PRINCE HENRY,"do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my"
1022,Henry IV,3,2.4.31,PRINCE HENRY,"puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do"
1023,Henry IV,3,2.4.32,PRINCE HENRY,"thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale"
1024,Henry IV,3,2.4.33,PRINCE HENRY,"to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and"
1025,Henry IV,3,2.4.34,PRINCE HENRY,I'll show thee a precedent.

1039,Henry IV,14,2.4.46,PRINCE HENRY,"of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant"
1040,Henry IV,14,2.4.47,PRINCE HENRY,as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
1041,Henry IV,14,2.4.48,PRINCE HENRY,a fair pair of heels and run from it?
1042,Henry IV,15,2.4.49,FRANCIS,"O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in"

1189,Henry IV,72,2.4.186,FALSTAFF,point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
1190,Henry IV,73,2.4.187,PRINCE HENRY,"What, four? thou saidst but two even now."
1191,Henry IV,74,2.4.188,FALSTAFF,"Four, Hal, I told thee four."
1192,Henry IV,75,2.4.189,POINS,"Ay, ay, he said four."
1193,Henry IV,76,2.4.190,FALSTAFF,"These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at"
1194,Henry IV,76,2.4.191,FALSTAFF,me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
1195,Henry IV,76,2.4.192,FALSTAFF,"points in my target, thus."
1196,Henry IV,77,2.4.193,PRINCE HENRY,"Seven? why, there were but four even now."
1197,Henry IV,78,2.4.194,FALSTAFF,In buckram?
1198,Henry IV,79,2.4.195,POINS,"Ay, four, in buckram suits."
1199,Henry IV,80,2.4.196,FALSTAFF,"Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else."
1200,Henry IV,81,2.4.197,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, let him alone, we shall have more anon."
1201,Henry IV,82,2.4.198,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear me, Hal?"
1202,Henry IV,83,2.4.199,PRINCE HENRY,"Ay, and mark thee too, Jack."
1203,Henry IV,84,2.4.200,FALSTAFF,"Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine"
1204,Henry IV,84,2.4.201,FALSTAFF,in buckram that I told thee of--
1205,Henry IV,85,2.4.202,PRINCE HENRY,"So, two more already."
1206,Henry IV,86,2.4.203,FALSTAFF,"Their points being broken,--"
1207,Henry IV,87,2.4.204,POINS,Down fell their hose.
1208,Henry IV,88,2.4.205,FALSTAFF,"Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,"
1209,Henry IV,88,2.4.206,FALSTAFF,"came in foot and hand, and with a thought seven of"
1210,Henry IV,88,2.4.207,FALSTAFF,the eleven I paid.
1211,Henry IV,89,2.4.208,PRINCE HENRY,O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
1212,Henry IV,90,2.4.209,FALSTAFF,"But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten"
1213,Henry IV,90,2.4.210,FALSTAFF,knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
1214,Henry IV,90,2.4.211,FALSTAFF,"at me, for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst"
1215,Henry IV,90,2.4.212,FALSTAFF,not see thy hand.
1216,Henry IV,91,2.4.213,PRINCE HENRY,"These lies are like their father that begets them,"
1217,Henry IV,91,2.4.214,PRINCE HENRY,"gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou"
1218,Henry IV,91,2.4.215,PRINCE HENRY,"clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou"
1219,Henry IV,91,2.4.216,PRINCE HENRY,"whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--"
1220,Henry IV,92,2.4.217,FALSTAFF,"What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth"
1221,Henry IV,92,2.4.218,FALSTAFF,the truth?
1222,Henry IV,93,2.4.219,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal"
1223,Henry IV,93,2.4.220,PRINCE HENRY,"green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy"
1224,Henry IV,93,2.4.221,PRINCE HENRY,"hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?"
1225,Henry IV,94,2.4.222,POINS,"Come, your reason, Jack, your reason."
1226,Henry IV,95,2.4.223,FALSTAFF,"What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the"
1227,Henry IV,95,2.4.224,FALSTAFF,"strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would"
1228,Henry IV,95,2.4.225,FALSTAFF,not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
1229,Henry IV,95,2.4.226,FALSTAFF,compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
1230,Henry IV,95,2.4.227,FALSTAFF,"blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon"
1231,Henry IV,95,2.4.228,FALSTAFF,"compulsion, I."
1232,Henry IV,96,2.4.229,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll be no longer guilty of this sin, this sanguine"
1233,Henry IV,96,2.4.230,PRINCE HENRY,"coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,"
1234,Henry IV,96,2.4.231,PRINCE HENRY,"this huge hill of flesh,--"
1235,Henry IV,97,2.4.232,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried"
1236,Henry IV,97,2.4.233,FALSTAFF,"neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O"
1237,Henry IV,97,2.4.234,FALSTAFF,for breath to utter what is like thee! you
1238,Henry IV,97,2.4.235,FALSTAFF,"tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase, you vile"
1239,Henry IV,97,2.4.236,FALSTAFF,"standing-tuck,--"
1240,Henry IV,98,2.4.237,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and"
1241,Henry IV,98,2.4.238,PRINCE HENRY,"when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,"
1242,Henry IV,98,2.4.239,PRINCE HENRY,hear me speak but this.
1243,Henry IV,99,2.4.240,POINS,"Mark, Jack."
1244,Henry IV,100,2.4.241,PRINCE HENRY,"We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and"
1245,Henry IV,100,2.4.242,PRINCE HENRY,"were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain"
1246,Henry IV,100,2.4.243,PRINCE HENRY,tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
1247,Henry IV,100,2.4.244,PRINCE HENRY,"four, and, with a word, out-faced you from your"
1248,Henry IV,100,2.4.245,PRINCE HENRY,"prize, and have it, yea, and can show it you here in"
1249,Henry IV,100,2.4.246,PRINCE HENRY,"the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts"
1250,Henry IV,100,2.4.247,PRINCE HENRY,"away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared"
1251,Henry IV,100,2.4.248,PRINCE HENRY,"for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard"
1252,Henry IV,100,2.4.249,PRINCE HENRY,"bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword"
1253,Henry IV,100,2.4.250,PRINCE HENRY,"as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!"
1254,Henry IV,100,2.4.251,PRINCE HENRY,"What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst"
1255,Henry IV,100,2.4.252,PRINCE HENRY,thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
1256,Henry IV,100,2.4.253,PRINCE HENRY,apparent shame?
1257,Henry IV,101,2.4.254,POINS,"Come, let's hear, Jack, what trick hast thou now?"
1258,Henry IV,102,2.4.255,FALSTAFF,"By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye."
1259,Henry IV,102,2.4.256,FALSTAFF,"Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the"
1260,Henry IV,102,2.4.257,FALSTAFF,heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
1261,Henry IV,102,2.4.258,FALSTAFF,"why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but"
1262,Henry IV,102,2.4.259,FALSTAFF,"beware instinct, the lion will not touch the true"
1263,Henry IV,102,2.4.260,FALSTAFF,"prince. Instinct is a great matter, I was now a"
1264,Henry IV,102,2.4.261,FALSTAFF,coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
1265,Henry IV,102,2.4.262,FALSTAFF,"myself and thee during my life, I for a valiant"
1266,Henry IV,102,2.4.263,FALSTAFF,"lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,"
1267,Henry IV,102,2.4.264,FALSTAFF,"lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap"
1268,Henry IV,102,2.4.265,FALSTAFF,"to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow."
1269,Henry IV,102,2.4.266,FALSTAFF,"Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles"
1270,Henry IV,102,2.4.267,FALSTAFF,"of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be"
1271,Henry IV,102,2.4.268,FALSTAFF,merry? shall we have a play extempore?
1272,Henry IV,103,2.4.269,PRINCE HENRY,"Content, and the argument shall be thy running away."
1273,Henry IV,104,2.4.270,FALSTAFF,"Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!"
1274,Henry IV,104,,FALSTAFF,Enter Hostess
1275,Henry IV,105,2.4.271,Hostess,"O Jesu, my lord the prince!"
1276,Henry IV,106,2.4.272,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to"
1277,Henry IV,106,2.4.273,PRINCE HENRY,me?
1278,Henry IV,107,2.4.274,Hostess,"Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at"
1279,Henry IV,107,2.4.275,Hostess,door would speak with you: he says he comes from
1280,Henry IV,107,2.4.276,Hostess,your father.
1281,Henry IV,108,2.4.277,PRINCE HENRY,"Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and"
1282,Henry IV,108,2.4.278,PRINCE HENRY,send him back again to my mother.
1283,Henry IV,109,2.4.279,FALSTAFF,What manner of man is he?
1284,Henry IV,110,2.4.280,Hostess,An old man.
1285,Henry IV,111,2.4.281,FALSTAFF,What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
1286,Henry IV,111,2.4.282,FALSTAFF,I give him his answer?
1287,Henry IV,112,2.4.283,PRINCE HENRY,"Prithee, do, Jack."
1288,Henry IV,113,2.4.284,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, and I'll send him packing."
1289,Henry IV,113,,FALSTAFF,Exit FALSTAFF
1290,Henry IV,114,2.4.285,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair, so did you,"
1291,Henry IV,114,2.4.286,PRINCE HENRY,"Peto, so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you"
1292,Henry IV,114,2.4.287,PRINCE HENRY,"ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true"
1293,Henry IV,114,2.4.288,PRINCE HENRY,"prince, no, fie!"
1294,Henry IV,115,2.4.289,BARDOLPH,"'Faith, I ran when I saw others run."
1295,Henry IV,116,2.4.290,PRINCE HENRY,"'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's"
1296,Henry IV,116,2.4.291,PRINCE HENRY,sword so hacked?
1297,Henry IV,117,2.4.292,PETO,"Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would"
1298,Henry IV,117,2.4.293,PETO,swear truth out of England but he would make you
1299,Henry IV,117,2.4.294,PETO,"believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like."
1300,Henry IV,118,2.4.295,BARDOLPH,"Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to"
1301,Henry IV,118,2.4.296,BARDOLPH,"make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments"
1302,Henry IV,118,2.4.297,BARDOLPH,with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
1303,Henry IV,118,2.4.298,BARDOLPH,"did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed"
1304,Henry IV,118,2.4.299,BARDOLPH,to hear his monstrous devices.
1305,Henry IV,119,2.4.300,PRINCE HENRY,"O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years"
1306,Henry IV,119,2.4.301,PRINCE HENRY,"ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since"
1307,Henry IV,119,2.4.302,PRINCE HENRY,thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
1308,Henry IV,119,2.4.303,PRINCE HENRY,"sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what"
1309,Henry IV,119,2.4.304,PRINCE HENRY,instinct hadst thou for it?
1310,Henry IV,120,2.4.305,BARDOLPH,"My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold"
1311,Henry IV,120,2.4.306,BARDOLPH,these exhalations?
1312,Henry IV,121,2.4.307,PRINCE HENRY,I do.
1313,Henry IV,122,2.4.308,BARDOLPH,What think you they portend?
1314,Henry IV,123,2.4.309,PRINCE HENRY,Hot livers and cold purses.
1315,Henry IV,124,2.4.310,BARDOLPH,"Choler, my lord, if rightly taken."
1316,Henry IV,125,2.4.311,PRINCE HENRY,"No, if rightly taken, halter."
1317,Henry IV,125,,PRINCE HENRY,Re-enter FALSTAFF
1318,Henry IV,125,2.4.312,PRINCE HENRY,"Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone."
1319,Henry IV,125,2.4.313,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, my sweet creature of bombast!"
1320,Henry IV,125,2.4.314,PRINCE HENRY,"How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?"
1321,Henry IV,126,2.4.315,FALSTAFF,"My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was"
1322,Henry IV,126,2.4.316,FALSTAFF,"not an eagle's talon in the waist, I could have"
1323,Henry IV,126,2.4.317,FALSTAFF,crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
1324,Henry IV,126,2.4.318,FALSTAFF,sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
1325,Henry IV,126,2.4.319,FALSTAFF,bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
1326,Henry IV,126,2.4.320,FALSTAFF,"Sir John Bracy from your father, you must to the"
1327,Henry IV,126,2.4.321,FALSTAFF,court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
1328,Henry IV,126,2.4.322,FALSTAFF,"north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the"
1329,Henry IV,126,2.4.323,FALSTAFF,bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
1330,Henry IV,126,2.4.324,FALSTAFF,devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
1331,Henry IV,126,2.4.325,FALSTAFF,hook--what a plague call you him?
1332,Henry IV,127,2.4.326,POINS,"O, Glendower."
1333,Henry IV,128,2.4.327,FALSTAFF,"Owen, Owen, the same, and his son-in-law Mortimer,"
1334,Henry IV,128,2.4.328,FALSTAFF,"and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of"
1335,Henry IV,128,2.4.329,FALSTAFF,"Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill"
1336,Henry IV,128,2.4.330,FALSTAFF,"perpendicular,--"
1337,Henry IV,129,2.4.331,PRINCE HENRY,He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
1338,Henry IV,129,2.4.332,PRINCE HENRY,kills a sparrow flying.
1339,Henry IV,130,2.4.333,FALSTAFF,You have hit it.
1340,Henry IV,131,2.4.334,PRINCE HENRY,So did he never the sparrow.
1341,Henry IV,132,2.4.335,FALSTAFF,"Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him, he will not run."
1342,Henry IV,133,2.4.336,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so"
1343,Henry IV,133,2.4.337,PRINCE HENRY,for running!
1344,Henry IV,134,2.4.338,FALSTAFF,"O' horseback, ye cuckoo, but afoot he will not budge a foot."
1345,Henry IV,135,2.4.339,PRINCE HENRY,"Yes, Jack, upon instinct."
1346,Henry IV,136,2.4.340,FALSTAFF,"I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,"
1347,Henry IV,136,2.4.341,FALSTAFF,"and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:"
1348,Henry IV,136,2.4.342,FALSTAFF,"Worcester is stolen away to-night, thy father's"
1349,Henry IV,136,2.4.343,FALSTAFF,beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
1350,Henry IV,136,2.4.344,FALSTAFF,land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
1351,Henry IV,137,2.4.345,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and"
1352,Henry IV,137,2.4.346,PRINCE HENRY,"this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads"
1353,Henry IV,137,2.4.347,PRINCE HENRY,"as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds."
1354,Henry IV,138,2.4.348,FALSTAFF,"By the mass, lad, thou sayest true, it is like we"
1355,Henry IV,138,2.4.349,FALSTAFF,"shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,"
1356,Henry IV,138,2.4.350,FALSTAFF,art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
1357,Henry IV,138,2.4.351,FALSTAFF,"heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three"
1358,Henry IV,138,2.4.352,FALSTAFF,"such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that"
1359,Henry IV,138,2.4.353,FALSTAFF,"spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou"
1360,Henry IV,138,2.4.354,FALSTAFF,not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
1361,Henry IV,138,2.4.355,FALSTAFF,it?
1362,Henry IV,139,2.4.356,PRINCE HENRY,"Not a whit, i' faith, I lack some of thy instinct."
1363,Henry IV,140,2.4.357,FALSTAFF,"Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou"
1364,Henry IV,140,2.4.358,FALSTAFF,"comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer."
1365,Henry IV,141,2.4.359,PRINCE HENRY,"Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the"
1366,Henry IV,141,2.4.360,PRINCE HENRY,particulars of my life.
1367,Henry IV,142,2.4.361,FALSTAFF,"Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,"
1368,Henry IV,142,2.4.362,FALSTAFF,"this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown."
1369,Henry IV,143,2.4.363,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden"
1370,Henry IV,143,2.4.364,PRINCE HENRY,"sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich"
1371,Henry IV,143,2.4.365,PRINCE HENRY,crown for a pitiful bald crown!
1372,Henry IV,144,2.4.366,FALSTAFF,"Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,"
1373,Henry IV,144,2.4.367,FALSTAFF,now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
1374,Henry IV,144,2.4.368,FALSTAFF,"make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have"
1375,Henry IV,144,2.4.369,FALSTAFF,"wept, for I must speak in passion, and I will do it"
1376,Henry IV,144,2.4.370,FALSTAFF,in King Cambyses' vein.
1377,Henry IV,145,2.4.371,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here is my leg."
1378,Henry IV,146,2.4.372,FALSTAFF,"And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility."
1379,Henry IV,147,2.4.373,Hostess,"O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!"
1380,Henry IV,148,2.4.374,FALSTAFF,"Weep not, sweet queen, for trickling tears are vain."
1381,Henry IV,149,2.4.375,Hostess,"O, the father, how he holds his countenance!"
1382,Henry IV,150,2.4.376,FALSTAFF,"For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen,"
1383,Henry IV,150,2.4.377,FALSTAFF,For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
1384,Henry IV,151,2.4.378,Hostess,"O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry"
1385,Henry IV,151,2.4.379,Hostess,players as ever I see!
1386,Henry IV,152,2.4.380,FALSTAFF,"Peace, good pint-pot, peace, good tickle-brain."
1387,Henry IV,152,2.4.381,FALSTAFF,"Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy"
1388,Henry IV,152,2.4.382,FALSTAFF,"time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though"
1389,Henry IV,152,2.4.383,FALSTAFF,"the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster"
1390,Henry IV,152,2.4.384,FALSTAFF,"it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the"
1391,Henry IV,152,2.4.385,FALSTAFF,"sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have"
1392,Henry IV,152,2.4.386,FALSTAFF,"partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,"
1393,Henry IV,152,2.4.387,FALSTAFF,but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
1394,Henry IV,152,2.4.388,FALSTAFF,"foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant"
1395,Henry IV,152,2.4.389,FALSTAFF,"me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point,"
1396,Henry IV,152,2.4.390,FALSTAFF,"why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall"
1397,Henry IV,152,2.4.391,FALSTAFF,the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
1398,Henry IV,152,2.4.392,FALSTAFF,blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
1399,Henry IV,152,2.4.393,FALSTAFF,the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
1400,Henry IV,152,2.4.394,FALSTAFF,"question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,"
1401,Henry IV,152,2.4.395,FALSTAFF,which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
1402,Henry IV,152,2.4.396,FALSTAFF,"many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,"
1403,Henry IV,152,2.4.397,FALSTAFF,"as ancient writers do report, doth defile, so doth"
1404,Henry IV,152,2.4.398,FALSTAFF,"the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not"
1405,Henry IV,152,2.4.399,FALSTAFF,"speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in"
1406,Henry IV,152,2.4.400,FALSTAFF,"pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in"
1407,Henry IV,152,2.4.401,FALSTAFF,woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
1408,Henry IV,152,2.4.402,FALSTAFF,"have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name."
1409,Henry IV,153,2.4.403,PRINCE HENRY,"What manner of man, an it like your majesty?"
1410,Henry IV,154,2.4.404,FALSTAFF,"A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent, of a"
1411,Henry IV,154,2.4.405,FALSTAFF,"cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble"
1412,Henry IV,154,2.4.406,FALSTAFF,"carriage, and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,"
1413,Henry IV,154,2.4.407,FALSTAFF,"by'r lady, inclining to three score, and now I"
1414,Henry IV,154,2.4.408,FALSTAFF,"remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man"
1415,Henry IV,154,2.4.409,FALSTAFF,"should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me, for, Harry,"
1416,Henry IV,154,2.4.410,FALSTAFF,I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
1417,Henry IV,154,2.4.411,FALSTAFF,"known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,"
1418,Henry IV,154,2.4.412,FALSTAFF,"peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that"
1419,Henry IV,154,2.4.413,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell"
1420,Henry IV,154,2.4.414,FALSTAFF,"me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast"
1421,Henry IV,154,2.4.415,FALSTAFF,thou been this month?
1422,Henry IV,155,2.4.416,PRINCE HENRY,"Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,"
1423,Henry IV,155,2.4.417,PRINCE HENRY,and I'll play my father.
1424,Henry IV,156,2.4.418,FALSTAFF,"Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so"
1425,Henry IV,156,2.4.419,FALSTAFF,"majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by"
1426,Henry IV,156,2.4.420,FALSTAFF,the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
1427,Henry IV,157,2.4.421,PRINCE HENRY,"Well, here I am set."
1428,Henry IV,158,2.4.422,FALSTAFF,"And here I stand: judge, my masters."
1429,Henry IV,159,2.4.423,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, Harry, whence come you?"
1430,Henry IV,160,2.4.424,FALSTAFF,"My noble lord, from Eastcheap."
1431,Henry IV,161,2.4.425,PRINCE HENRY,The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
1432,Henry IV,162,2.4.426,FALSTAFF,"'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle"
1433,Henry IV,162,2.4.427,FALSTAFF,"ye for a young prince, i' faith."
1434,Henry IV,163,2.4.428,PRINCE HENRY,"Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look"
1435,Henry IV,163,2.4.429,PRINCE HENRY,on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
1436,Henry IV,163,2.4.430,PRINCE HENRY,there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
1437,Henry IV,163,2.4.431,PRINCE HENRY,"old fat man, a tun of man is thy companion. Why"
1438,Henry IV,163,2.4.432,PRINCE HENRY,"dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that"
1439,Henry IV,163,2.4.433,PRINCE HENRY,"bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel"
1440,Henry IV,163,2.4.434,PRINCE HENRY,"of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed"
1441,Henry IV,163,2.4.435,PRINCE HENRY,"cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with"
1442,Henry IV,163,2.4.436,PRINCE HENRY,"the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that"
1443,Henry IV,163,2.4.437,PRINCE HENRY,"grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in"
1444,Henry IV,163,2.4.438,PRINCE HENRY,"years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and"
1445,Henry IV,163,2.4.439,PRINCE HENRY,"drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a"
1446,Henry IV,163,2.4.440,PRINCE HENRY,"capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?"
1447,Henry IV,163,2.4.441,PRINCE HENRY,"wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,"
1448,Henry IV,163,2.4.442,PRINCE HENRY,"but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?"
1449,Henry IV,164,2.4.443,FALSTAFF,I would your grace would take me with you: whom
1450,Henry IV,164,2.4.444,FALSTAFF,means your grace?
1451,Henry IV,165,2.4.445,PRINCE HENRY,"That villanous abominable misleader of youth,"
1452,Henry IV,165,2.4.446,PRINCE HENRY,"Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan."
1453,Henry IV,166,2.4.447,FALSTAFF,"My lord, the man I know."
1454,Henry IV,167,2.4.448,PRINCE HENRY,I know thou dost.
1455,Henry IV,168,2.4.449,FALSTAFF,"But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,"
1456,Henry IV,168,2.4.450,FALSTAFF,"were to say more than I know. That he is old, the"
1457,Henry IV,168,2.4.451,FALSTAFF,"more the pity, his white hairs do witness it, but"
1458,Henry IV,168,2.4.452,FALSTAFF,"that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,"
1459,Henry IV,168,2.4.453,FALSTAFF,"that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,"
1460,Henry IV,168,2.4.454,FALSTAFF,God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
1461,Henry IV,168,2.4.455,FALSTAFF,"sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if"
1462,Henry IV,168,2.4.456,FALSTAFF,"to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine"
1463,Henry IV,168,2.4.457,FALSTAFF,"are to be loved. No, my good lord, banish Peto,"
1464,Henry IV,168,2.4.458,FALSTAFF,"banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack"
1465,Henry IV,168,2.4.459,FALSTAFF,"Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,"
1466,Henry IV,168,2.4.460,FALSTAFF,"valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,"
1467,Henry IV,168,2.4.461,FALSTAFF,"being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him"
1468,Henry IV,168,2.4.462,FALSTAFF,"thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's"
1469,Henry IV,168,2.4.463,FALSTAFF,"company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world."
1470,Henry IV,169,2.4.464,PRINCE HENRY,"I do, I will."

1475,Henry IV,170,2.4.466,BARDOLPH,monstrous watch is at the door.
1476,Henry IV,171,2.4.467,FALSTAFF,"Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to"
1477,Henry IV,171,2.4.468,FALSTAFF,say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
1478,Henry IV,171,,FALSTAFF,Re-enter the Hostess
1479,Henry IV,172,2.4.469,Hostess,"O Jesu, my lord, my lord!"
1480,Henry IV,173,2.4.470,PRINCE HENRY,"Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:"
1481,Henry IV,173,2.4.471,PRINCE HENRY,what's the matter?
1482,Henry IV,174,2.4.472,Hostess,The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
1483,Henry IV,174,2.4.473,Hostess,are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
1484,Henry IV,175,2.4.474,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of"
1485,Henry IV,175,2.4.475,FALSTAFF,"gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,"
1486,Henry IV,175,2.4.476,FALSTAFF,without seeming so.
1487,Henry IV,176,2.4.477,PRINCE HENRY,"And thou a natural coward, without instinct."
1488,Henry IV,177,2.4.478,FALSTAFF,"I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,"
1489,Henry IV,177,2.4.479,FALSTAFF,"so, if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart"
1490,Henry IV,177,2.4.480,FALSTAFF,"as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!"
1491,Henry IV,177,2.4.481,FALSTAFF,I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
1492,Henry IV,178,2.4.482,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up"
1493,Henry IV,178,2.4.483,PRINCE HENRY,"above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good"
1494,Henry IV,178,2.4.484,PRINCE HENRY,conscience.
1495,Henry IV,179,2.4.485,FALSTAFF,"Both which I have had: but their date is out, and"
1496,Henry IV,179,2.4.486,FALSTAFF,therefore I'll hide me.
1497,Henry IV,180,2.4.487,PRINCE HENRY,Call in the sheriff.

1500,Henry IV,180,2.4.488,PRINCE HENRY,"Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?"
1501,Henry IV,181,2.4.489,Sheriff,"First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry"
1502,Henry IV,181,2.4.490,Sheriff,Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
1503,Henry IV,182,2.4.491,PRINCE HENRY,What men?
1504,Henry IV,183,2.4.492,Sheriff,"One of them is well known, my gracious lord,"
1505,Henry IV,183,2.4.493,Sheriff,A gross fat man.
1506,Henry IV,184,2.4.494,Carrier,As fat as butter.
1507,Henry IV,185,2.4.495,PRINCE HENRY,"The man, I do assure you, is not here,"
1508,Henry IV,185,2.4.496,PRINCE HENRY,For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
1509,Henry IV,185,2.4.497,PRINCE HENRY,"And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee"
1510,Henry IV,185,2.4.498,PRINCE HENRY,"That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,"
1511,Henry IV,185,2.4.499,PRINCE HENRY,"Send him to answer thee, or any man,"
1512,Henry IV,185,2.4.500,PRINCE HENRY,For any thing he shall be charged withal:
1513,Henry IV,185,2.4.501,PRINCE HENRY,And so let me entreat you leave the house.
1514,Henry IV,186,2.4.502,Sheriff,"I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen"
1515,Henry IV,186,2.4.503,Sheriff,Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
1516,Henry IV,187,2.4.504,PRINCE HENRY,"It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,"
1517,Henry IV,187,2.4.505,PRINCE HENRY,"He shall be answerable, and so farewell."
1518,Henry IV,188,2.4.506,Sheriff,"Good night, my noble lord."
1519,Henry IV,189,2.4.507,PRINCE HENRY,"I think it is good morrow, is it not?"

1524,Henry IV,192,2.4.511,PETO,"Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and"
1525,Henry IV,192,2.4.512,PETO,snorting like a horse.
1526,Henry IV,193,2.4.513,PRINCE HENRY,"Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets."
1527,Henry IV,193,,PRINCE HENRY,"He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers"
1528,Henry IV,193,2.4.514,PRINCE HENRY,What hast thou found?
1529,Henry IV,194,2.4.515,PETO,"Nothing but papers, my lord."
1530,Henry IV,195,2.4.516,PRINCE HENRY,Let's see what they be: read them.
1531,Henry IV,196,2.4.517,PETO,"[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d."
1532,Henry IV,196,2.4.518,PETO,"Item, Sauce,. . . 4d."

1535,Henry IV,196,2.4.521,PETO,"Item, Bread,        ob."
1536,Henry IV,197,2.4.522,PRINCE HENRY,O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
1537,Henry IV,197,2.4.523,PRINCE HENRY,"this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,"
1538,Henry IV,197,2.4.524,PRINCE HENRY,"keep close, we'll read it at more advantage: there"
1539,Henry IV,197,2.4.525,PRINCE HENRY,let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
1540,Henry IV,197,2.4.526,PRINCE HENRY,"morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place"
1541,Henry IV,197,2.4.527,PRINCE HENRY,shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
1542,Henry IV,197,2.4.528,PRINCE HENRY,"charge of foot, and I know his death will be a"
1543,Henry IV,197,2.4.529,PRINCE HENRY,march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
1544,Henry IV,197,2.4.530,PRINCE HENRY,back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
1545,Henry IV,197,2.4.531,PRINCE HENRY,"the morning, and so, good morrow, Peto."
1546,Henry IV,197,,PRINCE HENRY,Exeunt

1548,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,PETO,ACT III
1549,Henry IV,198,2.4.532,PETO,SCENE I. Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
1550,Henry IV,198,,PETO,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER"
1551,Henry IV,1,3.1.1,MORTIMER,"These promises are fair, the parties sure,"
1552,Henry IV,1,3.1.2,MORTIMER,And our induction full of prosperous hope.
1553,Henry IV,2,3.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,"
1554,Henry IV,2,3.1.4,HOTSPUR,Will you sit down?
1555,Henry IV,2,3.1.5,HOTSPUR,And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
1556,Henry IV,2,3.1.6,HOTSPUR,I have forgot the map.
1557,Henry IV,3,3.1.7,GLENDOWER,"No, here it is."
1558,Henry IV,3,3.1.8,GLENDOWER,"Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,"
1559,Henry IV,3,3.1.9,GLENDOWER,For by that name as oft as Lancaster
1560,Henry IV,3,3.1.10,GLENDOWER,"Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with"
1561,Henry IV,3,3.1.11,GLENDOWER,A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
1562,Henry IV,4,3.1.12,HOTSPUR,"And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of."
1563,Henry IV,5,3.1.13,GLENDOWER,I cannot blame him: at my nativity
1564,Henry IV,5,3.1.14,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1565,Henry IV,5,3.1.15,GLENDOWER,"Of burning cressets, and at my birth"
1566,Henry IV,5,3.1.16,GLENDOWER,The frame and huge foundation of the earth
1567,Henry IV,5,3.1.17,GLENDOWER,Shaked like a coward.
1568,Henry IV,6,3.1.18,HOTSPUR,"Why, so it would have done at the same season, if"
1569,Henry IV,6,3.1.19,HOTSPUR,"your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself"
1570,Henry IV,6,3.1.20,HOTSPUR,had never been born.
1571,Henry IV,7,3.1.21,GLENDOWER,I say the earth did shake when I was born.
1572,Henry IV,8,3.1.22,HOTSPUR,"And I say the earth was not of my mind,"
1573,Henry IV,8,3.1.23,HOTSPUR,If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
1574,Henry IV,9,3.1.24,GLENDOWER,"The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble."
1575,Henry IV,10,3.1.25,HOTSPUR,"O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,"
1576,Henry IV,10,3.1.26,HOTSPUR,And not in fear of your nativity.
1577,Henry IV,10,3.1.27,HOTSPUR,Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
1578,Henry IV,10,3.1.28,HOTSPUR,"In strange eruptions, oft the teeming earth"
1579,Henry IV,10,3.1.29,HOTSPUR,Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
1580,Henry IV,10,3.1.30,HOTSPUR,By the imprisoning of unruly wind
1581,Henry IV,10,3.1.31,HOTSPUR,"Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,"
1582,Henry IV,10,3.1.32,HOTSPUR,Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
1583,Henry IV,10,3.1.33,HOTSPUR,Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
1584,Henry IV,10,3.1.34,HOTSPUR,"Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,"
1585,Henry IV,10,3.1.35,HOTSPUR,In passion shook.
1586,Henry IV,11,3.1.36,GLENDOWER,"Cousin, of many men"
1587,Henry IV,11,3.1.37,GLENDOWER,I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
1588,Henry IV,11,3.1.38,GLENDOWER,To tell you once again that at my birth
1589,Henry IV,11,3.1.39,GLENDOWER,"The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,"
1590,Henry IV,11,3.1.40,GLENDOWER,"The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds"
1591,Henry IV,11,3.1.41,GLENDOWER,Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
1592,Henry IV,11,3.1.42,GLENDOWER,"These signs have mark'd me extraordinary,"
1593,Henry IV,11,3.1.43,GLENDOWER,And all the courses of my life do show
1594,Henry IV,11,3.1.44,GLENDOWER,I am not in the roll of common men.
1595,Henry IV,11,3.1.45,GLENDOWER,"Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea"
1596,Henry IV,11,3.1.46,GLENDOWER,"That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,"
1597,Henry IV,11,3.1.47,GLENDOWER,"Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?"
1598,Henry IV,11,3.1.48,GLENDOWER,And bring him out that is but woman's son
1599,Henry IV,11,3.1.49,GLENDOWER,Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
1600,Henry IV,11,3.1.50,GLENDOWER,And hold me pace in deep experiments.
1601,Henry IV,12,3.1.51,HOTSPUR,I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
1602,Henry IV,12,3.1.52,HOTSPUR,I'll to dinner.
1603,Henry IV,13,3.1.53,MORTIMER,"Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad."
1604,Henry IV,14,3.1.54,GLENDOWER,I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
1605,Henry IV,15,3.1.55,HOTSPUR,"Why, so can I, or so can any man,"
1606,Henry IV,15,3.1.56,HOTSPUR,But will they come when you do call for them?
1607,Henry IV,16,3.1.57,GLENDOWER,"Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command"
1608,Henry IV,16,3.1.58,GLENDOWER,The devil.
1609,Henry IV,17,3.1.59,HOTSPUR,"And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil"
1610,Henry IV,17,3.1.60,HOTSPUR,By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
1611,Henry IV,17,3.1.61,HOTSPUR,"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,"
1612,Henry IV,17,3.1.62,HOTSPUR,And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
1613,Henry IV,17,3.1.63,HOTSPUR,"O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!"
1614,Henry IV,18,3.1.64,MORTIMER,"Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat."
1615,Henry IV,19,3.1.65,GLENDOWER,Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
1616,Henry IV,19,3.1.66,GLENDOWER,"Against my power, thrice from the banks of Wye"
1617,Henry IV,19,3.1.67,GLENDOWER,And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
1618,Henry IV,19,3.1.68,GLENDOWER,Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
1619,Henry IV,20,3.1.69,HOTSPUR,"Home without boots, and in foul weather too!"
1620,Henry IV,20,3.1.70,HOTSPUR,"How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?"
1621,Henry IV,21,3.1.71,GLENDOWER,"Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right"
1622,Henry IV,21,3.1.72,GLENDOWER,According to our threefold order ta'en?
1623,Henry IV,22,3.1.73,MORTIMER,The archdeacon hath divided it
1624,Henry IV,22,3.1.74,MORTIMER,Into three limits very equally:
1625,Henry IV,22,3.1.75,MORTIMER,"England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,"
1626,Henry IV,22,3.1.76,MORTIMER,By south and east is to my part assign'd:
1627,Henry IV,22,3.1.77,MORTIMER,"All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,"
1628,Henry IV,22,3.1.78,MORTIMER,"And all the fertile land within that bound,"
1629,Henry IV,22,3.1.79,MORTIMER,"To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you"
1630,Henry IV,22,3.1.80,MORTIMER,"The remnant northward, lying off from Trent."
1631,Henry IV,22,3.1.81,MORTIMER,"And our indentures tripartite are drawn,"
1632,Henry IV,22,3.1.82,MORTIMER,"Which being sealed interchangeably,"
1633,Henry IV,22,3.1.83,MORTIMER,"A business that this night may execute,"
1634,Henry IV,22,3.1.84,MORTIMER,"To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I"
1635,Henry IV,22,3.1.85,MORTIMER,And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
1636,Henry IV,22,3.1.86,MORTIMER,"To meet your father and the Scottish power,"
1637,Henry IV,22,3.1.87,MORTIMER,"As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury."
1638,Henry IV,22,3.1.88,MORTIMER,"My father Glendower is not ready yet,"
1639,Henry IV,22,3.1.89,MORTIMER,Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
1640,Henry IV,22,3.1.90,MORTIMER,Within that space you may have drawn together
1641,Henry IV,22,3.1.91,MORTIMER,"Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen."
1642,Henry IV,23,3.1.92,GLENDOWER,"A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:"
1643,Henry IV,23,3.1.93,GLENDOWER,"And in my conduct shall your ladies come,"
1644,Henry IV,23,3.1.94,GLENDOWER,"From whom you now must steal and take no leave,"
1645,Henry IV,23,3.1.95,GLENDOWER,For there will be a world of water shed
1646,Henry IV,23,3.1.96,GLENDOWER,Upon the parting of your wives and you.
1647,Henry IV,24,3.1.97,HOTSPUR,"Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,"
1648,Henry IV,24,3.1.98,HOTSPUR,In quantity equals not one of yours:
1649,Henry IV,24,3.1.99,HOTSPUR,"See how this river comes me cranking in,"
1650,Henry IV,24,3.1.100,HOTSPUR,And cuts me from the best of all my land
1651,Henry IV,24,3.1.101,HOTSPUR,"A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out."
1652,Henry IV,24,3.1.102,HOTSPUR,"I'll have the current in this place damm'd up,"
1653,Henry IV,24,3.1.103,HOTSPUR,And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
1654,Henry IV,24,3.1.104,HOTSPUR,"In a new channel, fair and evenly,"
1655,Henry IV,24,3.1.105,HOTSPUR,"It shall not wind with such a deep indent,"
1656,Henry IV,24,3.1.106,HOTSPUR,To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
1657,Henry IV,25,3.1.107,GLENDOWER,"Not wind? it shall, it must, you see it doth."
1658,Henry IV,26,3.1.108,MORTIMER,"Yea, but"
1659,Henry IV,26,3.1.109,MORTIMER,"Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up"
1660,Henry IV,26,3.1.110,MORTIMER,"With like advantage on the other side,"
1661,Henry IV,26,3.1.111,MORTIMER,Gelding the opposed continent as much
1662,Henry IV,26,3.1.112,MORTIMER,As on the other side it takes from you.
1663,Henry IV,27,3.1.113,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yea, but a little charge will trench him here"
1664,Henry IV,27,3.1.114,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on this north side win this cape of land,"
1665,Henry IV,27,3.1.115,EARL OF WORCESTER,And then he runs straight and even.
1666,Henry IV,28,3.1.116,HOTSPUR,I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
1667,Henry IV,29,3.1.117,GLENDOWER,I'll not have it alter'd.
1668,Henry IV,30,3.1.118,HOTSPUR,Will not you?
1669,Henry IV,31,3.1.119,GLENDOWER,"No, nor you shall not."
1670,Henry IV,32,3.1.120,HOTSPUR,Who shall say me nay?
1671,Henry IV,33,3.1.121,GLENDOWER,"Why, that will I."
1672,Henry IV,34,3.1.122,HOTSPUR,"Let me not understand you, then, speak it in Welsh."
1673,Henry IV,35,3.1.123,GLENDOWER,"I can speak English, lord, as well as you,"
1674,Henry IV,35,3.1.124,GLENDOWER,"For I was train'd up in the English court,"
1675,Henry IV,35,3.1.125,GLENDOWER,"Where, being but young, I framed to the harp"
1676,Henry IV,35,3.1.126,GLENDOWER,Many an English ditty lovely well
1677,Henry IV,35,3.1.127,GLENDOWER,"And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,"
1678,Henry IV,35,3.1.128,GLENDOWER,A virtue that was never seen in you.
1679,Henry IV,36,3.1.129,HOTSPUR,"Marry,"
1680,Henry IV,36,3.1.130,HOTSPUR,And I am glad of it with all my heart:
1681,Henry IV,36,3.1.131,HOTSPUR,I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
1682,Henry IV,36,3.1.132,HOTSPUR,"Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers,"
1683,Henry IV,36,3.1.133,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,"
1684,Henry IV,36,3.1.134,HOTSPUR,"Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,"
1685,Henry IV,36,3.1.135,HOTSPUR,"And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,"
1686,Henry IV,36,3.1.136,HOTSPUR,Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
1687,Henry IV,36,3.1.137,HOTSPUR,'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
1688,Henry IV,37,3.1.138,GLENDOWER,"Come, you shall have Trent turn'd."
1689,Henry IV,38,3.1.139,HOTSPUR,I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
1690,Henry IV,38,3.1.140,HOTSPUR,"To any well-deserving friend,"
1691,Henry IV,38,3.1.141,HOTSPUR,"But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,"
1692,Henry IV,38,3.1.142,HOTSPUR,I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
1693,Henry IV,38,3.1.143,HOTSPUR,Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
1694,Henry IV,39,3.1.144,GLENDOWER,"The moon shines fair, you may away by night:"
1695,Henry IV,39,3.1.145,GLENDOWER,I'll haste the writer and withal
1696,Henry IV,39,3.1.146,GLENDOWER,Break with your wives of your departure hence:
1697,Henry IV,39,3.1.147,GLENDOWER,"I am afraid my daughter will run mad,"
1698,Henry IV,39,3.1.148,GLENDOWER,So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
1699,Henry IV,39,,GLENDOWER,Exit GLENDOWER
1700,Henry IV,40,3.1.149,MORTIMER,"Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!"
1701,Henry IV,41,3.1.150,HOTSPUR,I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
1702,Henry IV,41,3.1.151,HOTSPUR,"With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,"
1703,Henry IV,41,3.1.152,HOTSPUR,"Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,"
1704,Henry IV,41,3.1.153,HOTSPUR,"And of a dragon and a finless fish,"
1705,Henry IV,41,3.1.154,HOTSPUR,"A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,"
1706,Henry IV,41,3.1.155,HOTSPUR,"A couching lion and a ramping cat,"
1707,Henry IV,41,3.1.156,HOTSPUR,And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
1708,Henry IV,41,3.1.157,HOTSPUR,"As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,"
1709,Henry IV,41,3.1.158,HOTSPUR,He held me last night at least nine hours
1710,Henry IV,41,3.1.159,HOTSPUR,In reckoning up the several devils' names
1711,Henry IV,41,3.1.160,HOTSPUR,"That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'"
1712,Henry IV,41,3.1.161,HOTSPUR,"But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious"
1713,Henry IV,41,3.1.162,HOTSPUR,"As a tired horse, a railing wife,"
1714,Henry IV,41,3.1.163,HOTSPUR,Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
1715,Henry IV,41,3.1.164,HOTSPUR,"With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,"
1716,Henry IV,41,3.1.165,HOTSPUR,Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
1717,Henry IV,41,3.1.166,HOTSPUR,In any summer-house in Christendom.
1718,Henry IV,42,3.1.167,MORTIMER,"In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,"
1719,Henry IV,42,3.1.168,MORTIMER,"Exceedingly well read, and profited"
1720,Henry IV,42,3.1.169,MORTIMER,"In strange concealments, valiant as a lion"
1721,Henry IV,42,3.1.170,MORTIMER,And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
1722,Henry IV,42,3.1.171,MORTIMER,"As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?"
1723,Henry IV,42,3.1.172,MORTIMER,He holds your temper in a high respect
1724,Henry IV,42,3.1.173,MORTIMER,And curbs himself even of his natural scope
1725,Henry IV,42,3.1.174,MORTIMER,"When you come 'cross his humour, faith, he does:"
1726,Henry IV,42,3.1.175,MORTIMER,"I warrant you, that man is not alive"
1727,Henry IV,42,3.1.176,MORTIMER,"Might so have tempted him as you have done,"
1728,Henry IV,42,3.1.177,MORTIMER,Without the taste of danger and reproof:
1729,Henry IV,42,3.1.178,MORTIMER,"But do not use it oft, let me entreat you."
1730,Henry IV,43,3.1.179,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame,"
1731,Henry IV,43,3.1.180,EARL OF WORCESTER,And since your coming hither have done enough
1732,Henry IV,43,3.1.181,EARL OF WORCESTER,To put him quite beside his patience.
1733,Henry IV,43,3.1.182,EARL OF WORCESTER,"You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:"
1734,Henry IV,43,3.1.183,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--"
1735,Henry IV,43,3.1.184,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--"
1736,Henry IV,43,3.1.185,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,"
1737,Henry IV,43,3.1.186,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Defect of manners, want of government,"
1738,Henry IV,43,3.1.187,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:"
1739,Henry IV,43,3.1.188,EARL OF WORCESTER,The least of which haunting a nobleman
1740,Henry IV,43,3.1.189,EARL OF WORCESTER,Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
1741,Henry IV,43,3.1.190,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Upon the beauty of all parts besides,"
1742,Henry IV,43,3.1.191,EARL OF WORCESTER,Beguiling them of commendation.
1743,Henry IV,44,3.1.192,HOTSPUR,"Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!"
1744,Henry IV,44,3.1.193,HOTSPUR,"Here come our wives, and let us take our leave."
1745,Henry IV,44,,HOTSPUR,Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies
1746,Henry IV,45,3.1.194,MORTIMER,"This is the deadly spite that angers me,"
1747,Henry IV,45,3.1.195,MORTIMER,"My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh."
1748,Henry IV,46,3.1.196,GLENDOWER,"My daughter weeps: she will not part with you,"
1749,Henry IV,46,3.1.197,GLENDOWER,"She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars."
1750,Henry IV,47,3.1.198,MORTIMER,"Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy"
1751,Henry IV,47,3.1.199,MORTIMER,Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
1752,Henry IV,47,,MORTIMER,"Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same"
1753,Henry IV,48,3.1.200,GLENDOWER,"She is desperate here, a peevish self-wind harlotry,"
1754,Henry IV,48,3.1.201,GLENDOWER,one that no persuasion can do good upon.
1755,Henry IV,48,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks in Welsh
1756,Henry IV,49,3.1.202,MORTIMER,I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
1757,Henry IV,49,3.1.203,MORTIMER,Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
1758,Henry IV,49,3.1.204,MORTIMER,"I am too perfect in, and, but for shame,"
1759,Henry IV,49,3.1.205,MORTIMER,In such a parley should I answer thee.
1760,Henry IV,49,,MORTIMER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1761,Henry IV,49,3.1.206,MORTIMER,"I understand thy kisses and thou mine,"
1762,Henry IV,49,3.1.207,MORTIMER,And that's a feeling disputation:
1763,Henry IV,49,3.1.208,MORTIMER,"But I will never be a truant, love,"
1764,Henry IV,49,3.1.209,MORTIMER,"Till I have learned thy language, for thy tongue"
1765,Henry IV,49,3.1.210,MORTIMER,"Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,"
1766,Henry IV,49,3.1.211,MORTIMER,"Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,"
1767,Henry IV,49,3.1.212,MORTIMER,"With ravishing division, to her lute."
1768,Henry IV,50,3.1.213,GLENDOWER,"Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad."
1769,Henry IV,50,,GLENDOWER,The lady speaks again in Welsh
1770,Henry IV,51,3.1.214,MORTIMER,"O, I am ignorance itself in this!"
1771,Henry IV,52,3.1.215,GLENDOWER,She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
1772,Henry IV,52,3.1.216,GLENDOWER,"And rest your gentle head upon her lap,"
1773,Henry IV,52,3.1.217,GLENDOWER,And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
1774,Henry IV,52,3.1.218,GLENDOWER,And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
1775,Henry IV,52,3.1.219,GLENDOWER,"Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,"
1776,Henry IV,52,3.1.220,GLENDOWER,Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
1777,Henry IV,52,3.1.221,GLENDOWER,As is the difference betwixt day and night
1778,Henry IV,52,3.1.222,GLENDOWER,The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
1779,Henry IV,52,3.1.223,GLENDOWER,Begins his golden progress in the east.
1780,Henry IV,53,3.1.224,MORTIMER,With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
1781,Henry IV,53,3.1.225,MORTIMER,"By that time will our book, I think, be drawn"
1782,Henry IV,54,3.1.226,GLENDOWER,"Do so,"
1783,Henry IV,54,3.1.227,GLENDOWER,And those musicians that shall play to you
1784,Henry IV,54,3.1.228,GLENDOWER,"Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,"
1785,Henry IV,54,3.1.229,GLENDOWER,"And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend."
1786,Henry IV,55,3.1.230,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,"
1787,Henry IV,55,3.1.231,HOTSPUR,"quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap."
1788,Henry IV,56,3.1.232,LADY PERCY,"Go, ye giddy goose."
1789,Henry IV,56,,LADY PERCY,The music plays
1790,Henry IV,57,3.1.233,HOTSPUR,"Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,"
1791,Henry IV,57,3.1.234,HOTSPUR,And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
1792,Henry IV,57,3.1.235,HOTSPUR,"By'r lady, he is a good musician."
1793,Henry IV,58,3.1.236,LADY PERCY,Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
1794,Henry IV,58,3.1.237,LADY PERCY,"altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,"
1795,Henry IV,58,3.1.238,LADY PERCY,and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
1796,Henry IV,59,3.1.239,HOTSPUR,"I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish."
1797,Henry IV,60,3.1.240,LADY PERCY,Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
1798,Henry IV,61,3.1.241,HOTSPUR,No.
1799,Henry IV,62,3.1.242,LADY PERCY,Then be still.
1800,Henry IV,63,3.1.243,HOTSPUR,"Neither,'tis a woman's fault."
1801,Henry IV,64,3.1.244,LADY PERCY,Now God help thee!
1802,Henry IV,65,3.1.245,HOTSPUR,To the Welsh lady's bed.
1803,Henry IV,66,3.1.246,LADY PERCY,What's that?
1804,Henry IV,67,3.1.247,HOTSPUR,Peace! she sings.
1805,Henry IV,67,,HOTSPUR,Here the lady sings a Welsh song
1806,Henry IV,68,3.1.248,HOTSPUR,"Come, Kate, I'll have your song too."
1807,Henry IV,69,3.1.249,LADY PERCY,"Not mine, in good sooth."
1808,Henry IV,70,3.1.250,HOTSPUR,"Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a"
1809,Henry IV,70,3.1.251,HOTSPUR,"comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and"
1810,Henry IV,70,3.1.252,HOTSPUR,"'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and"
1811,Henry IV,70,3.1.253,HOTSPUR,"'as sure as day,'"
1812,Henry IV,70,3.1.254,HOTSPUR,"And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,"
1813,Henry IV,70,3.1.255,HOTSPUR,As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
1814,Henry IV,70,3.1.256,HOTSPUR,"Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,"
1815,Henry IV,70,3.1.257,HOTSPUR,"A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'"
1816,Henry IV,70,3.1.258,HOTSPUR,"And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,"
1817,Henry IV,70,3.1.259,HOTSPUR,To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
1818,Henry IV,70,3.1.260,HOTSPUR,"Come, sing."
1819,Henry IV,71,3.1.261,LADY PERCY,I will not sing.
1820,Henry IV,72,3.1.262,HOTSPUR,"'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast"
1821,Henry IV,72,3.1.263,HOTSPUR,"teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away"
1822,Henry IV,72,3.1.264,HOTSPUR,"within these two hours, and so, come in when ye will."
1823,Henry IV,72,,HOTSPUR,Exit
1824,Henry IV,73,3.1.265,GLENDOWER,"Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow"
1825,Henry IV,73,3.1.266,GLENDOWER,As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
1826,Henry IV,73,3.1.267,GLENDOWER,"By this our book is drawn, we'll but seal,"
1827,Henry IV,73,3.1.268,GLENDOWER,And then to horse immediately.
1828,Henry IV,74,3.1.269,MORTIMER,With all my heart.
1829,Henry IV,74,,MORTIMER,Exeunt
1830,Henry IV,74,,MORTIMER,SCENE II. London. The palace.
1831,Henry IV,74,,MORTIMER,"Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others"
1832,Henry IV,1,3.2.1,KING HENRY IV,"Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I"
1833,Henry IV,1,3.2.2,KING HENRY IV,"Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,"
1834,Henry IV,1,3.2.3,KING HENRY IV,For we shall presently have need of you.
1835,Henry IV,1,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt Lords
1836,Henry IV,1,3.2.4,KING HENRY IV,"I know not whether God will have it so,"
1837,Henry IV,1,3.2.5,KING HENRY IV,"For some displeasing service I have done,"
1838,Henry IV,1,3.2.6,KING HENRY IV,"That, in his secret doom, out of my blood"
1839,Henry IV,1,3.2.7,KING HENRY IV,"He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me,"
1840,Henry IV,1,3.2.8,KING HENRY IV,But thou dost in thy passages of life
1841,Henry IV,1,3.2.9,KING HENRY IV,Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
1842,Henry IV,1,3.2.10,KING HENRY IV,For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
1843,Henry IV,1,3.2.11,KING HENRY IV,"To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,"
1844,Henry IV,1,3.2.12,KING HENRY IV,"Could such inordinate and low desires,"
1845,Henry IV,1,3.2.13,KING HENRY IV,"Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,"
1846,Henry IV,1,3.2.14,KING HENRY IV,"Such barren pleasures, rude society,"
1847,Henry IV,1,3.2.15,KING HENRY IV,"As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,"
1848,Henry IV,1,3.2.16,KING HENRY IV,Accompany the greatness of thy blood
1849,Henry IV,1,3.2.17,KING HENRY IV,And hold their level with thy princely heart?
1850,Henry IV,2,3.2.18,PRINCE HENRY,"So please your majesty, I would I could"
1851,Henry IV,2,3.2.19,PRINCE HENRY,Quit all offences with as clear excuse
1852,Henry IV,2,3.2.20,PRINCE HENRY,As well as I am doubtless I can purge
1853,Henry IV,2,3.2.21,PRINCE HENRY,Myself of many I am charged withal:
1854,Henry IV,2,3.2.22,PRINCE HENRY,"Yet such extenuation let me beg,"
1855,Henry IV,2,3.2.23,PRINCE HENRY,"As, in reproof of many tales devised,"
1856,Henry IV,2,3.2.24,PRINCE HENRY,"which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,"
1857,Henry IV,2,3.2.25,PRINCE HENRY,"By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,"
1858,Henry IV,2,3.2.26,PRINCE HENRY,"I may, for some things true, wherein my youth"
1859,Henry IV,2,3.2.27,PRINCE HENRY,"Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,"
1860,Henry IV,2,3.2.28,PRINCE HENRY,Find pardon on my true submission.
1861,Henry IV,3,3.2.29,KING HENRY IV,"God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,"
1862,Henry IV,3,3.2.30,KING HENRY IV,"At thy affections, which do hold a wing"
1863,Henry IV,3,3.2.31,KING HENRY IV,Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
1864,Henry IV,3,3.2.32,KING HENRY IV,Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
1865,Henry IV,3,3.2.33,KING HENRY IV,"Which by thy younger brother is supplied,"
1866,Henry IV,3,3.2.34,KING HENRY IV,And art almost an alien to the hearts
1867,Henry IV,3,3.2.35,KING HENRY IV,Of all the court and princes of my blood:
1868,Henry IV,3,3.2.36,KING HENRY IV,The hope and expectation of thy time
1869,Henry IV,3,3.2.37,KING HENRY IV,"Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man"
1870,Henry IV,3,3.2.38,KING HENRY IV,Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
1871,Henry IV,3,3.2.39,KING HENRY IV,"Had I so lavish of my presence been,"
1872,Henry IV,3,3.2.40,KING HENRY IV,"So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,"
1873,Henry IV,3,3.2.41,KING HENRY IV,"So stale and cheap to vulgar company,"
1874,Henry IV,3,3.2.42,KING HENRY IV,"Opinion, that did help me to the crown,"
1875,Henry IV,3,3.2.43,KING HENRY IV,Had still kept loyal to possession
1876,Henry IV,3,3.2.44,KING HENRY IV,"And left me in reputeless banishment,"
1877,Henry IV,3,3.2.45,KING HENRY IV,A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
1878,Henry IV,3,3.2.46,KING HENRY IV,"By being seldom seen, I could not stir"
1879,Henry IV,3,3.2.47,KING HENRY IV,"But like a comet I was wonder'd at,"
1880,Henry IV,3,3.2.48,KING HENRY IV,"That men would tell their children 'This is he,'"
1881,Henry IV,3,3.2.49,KING HENRY IV,"Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'"
1882,Henry IV,3,3.2.50,KING HENRY IV,"And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,"
1883,Henry IV,3,3.2.51,KING HENRY IV,And dress'd myself in such humility
1884,Henry IV,3,3.2.52,KING HENRY IV,"That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,"
1885,Henry IV,3,3.2.53,KING HENRY IV,"Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,"
1886,Henry IV,3,3.2.54,KING HENRY IV,Even in the presence of the crowned king.
1887,Henry IV,3,3.2.55,KING HENRY IV,"Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,"
1888,Henry IV,3,3.2.56,KING HENRY IV,"My presence, like a robe pontifical,"
1889,Henry IV,3,3.2.57,KING HENRY IV,"Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,"
1890,Henry IV,3,3.2.58,KING HENRY IV,"Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast"
1891,Henry IV,3,3.2.59,KING HENRY IV,And won by rareness such solemnity.
1892,Henry IV,3,3.2.60,KING HENRY IV,"The skipping king, he ambled up and down"
1893,Henry IV,3,3.2.61,KING HENRY IV,"With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,"
1894,Henry IV,3,3.2.62,KING HENRY IV,"Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,"
1895,Henry IV,3,3.2.63,KING HENRY IV,"Mingled his royalty with capering fools,"
1896,Henry IV,3,3.2.64,KING HENRY IV,Had his great name profaned with their scorns
1897,Henry IV,3,3.2.65,KING HENRY IV,"And gave his countenance, against his name,"
1898,Henry IV,3,3.2.66,KING HENRY IV,To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
1899,Henry IV,3,3.2.67,KING HENRY IV,"Of every beardless vain comparative,"
1900,Henry IV,3,3.2.68,KING HENRY IV,"Grew a companion to the common streets,"
1901,Henry IV,3,3.2.69,KING HENRY IV,"Enfeoff'd himself to popularity,"
1902,Henry IV,3,3.2.70,KING HENRY IV,"That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,"
1903,Henry IV,3,3.2.71,KING HENRY IV,They surfeited with honey and began
1904,Henry IV,3,3.2.72,KING HENRY IV,"To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little"
1905,Henry IV,3,3.2.73,KING HENRY IV,More than a little is by much too much.
1906,Henry IV,3,3.2.74,KING HENRY IV,"So when he had occasion to be seen,"
1907,Henry IV,3,3.2.75,KING HENRY IV,"He was but as the cuckoo is in June,"
1908,Henry IV,3,3.2.76,KING HENRY IV,"Heard, not regarded, seen, but with such eyes"
1909,Henry IV,3,3.2.77,KING HENRY IV,"As, sick and blunted with community,"
1910,Henry IV,3,3.2.78,KING HENRY IV,"Afford no extraordinary gaze,"
1911,Henry IV,3,3.2.79,KING HENRY IV,Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
1912,Henry IV,3,3.2.80,KING HENRY IV,"When it shines seldom in admiring eyes,"
1913,Henry IV,3,3.2.81,KING HENRY IV,"But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,"
1914,Henry IV,3,3.2.82,KING HENRY IV,Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
1915,Henry IV,3,3.2.83,KING HENRY IV,"As cloudy men use to their adversaries,"
1916,Henry IV,3,3.2.84,KING HENRY IV,"Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full."
1917,Henry IV,3,3.2.85,KING HENRY IV,"And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,"
1918,Henry IV,3,3.2.86,KING HENRY IV,For thou has lost thy princely privilege
1919,Henry IV,3,3.2.87,KING HENRY IV,With vile participation: not an eye
1920,Henry IV,3,3.2.88,KING HENRY IV,"But is a-weary of thy common sight,"
1921,Henry IV,3,3.2.89,KING HENRY IV,"Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more,"
1922,Henry IV,3,3.2.90,KING HENRY IV,"Which now doth that I would not have it do,"
1923,Henry IV,3,3.2.91,KING HENRY IV,Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
1924,Henry IV,4,3.2.92,PRINCE HENRY,"I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,"
1925,Henry IV,4,3.2.93,PRINCE HENRY,Be more myself.
1926,Henry IV,5,3.2.94,KING HENRY IV,For all the world
1927,Henry IV,5,3.2.95,KING HENRY IV,As thou art to this hour was Richard then
1928,Henry IV,5,3.2.96,KING HENRY IV,"When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,"
1929,Henry IV,5,3.2.97,KING HENRY IV,And even as I was then is Percy now.
1930,Henry IV,5,3.2.98,KING HENRY IV,"Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,"
1931,Henry IV,5,3.2.99,KING HENRY IV,He hath more worthy interest to the state
1932,Henry IV,5,3.2.100,KING HENRY IV,"Than thou the shadow of succession,"
1933,Henry IV,5,3.2.101,KING HENRY IV,"For of no right, nor colour like to right,"
1934,Henry IV,5,3.2.102,KING HENRY IV,"He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,"
1935,Henry IV,5,3.2.103,KING HENRY IV,"Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,"
1936,Henry IV,5,3.2.104,KING HENRY IV,"And, being no more in debt to years than thou,"
1937,Henry IV,5,3.2.105,KING HENRY IV,Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
1938,Henry IV,5,3.2.106,KING HENRY IV,To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
1939,Henry IV,5,3.2.107,KING HENRY IV,What never-dying honour hath he got
1940,Henry IV,5,3.2.108,KING HENRY IV,"Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,"
1941,Henry IV,5,3.2.109,KING HENRY IV,Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
1942,Henry IV,5,3.2.110,KING HENRY IV,Holds from all soldiers chief majority
1943,Henry IV,5,3.2.111,KING HENRY IV,And military title capital
1944,Henry IV,5,3.2.112,KING HENRY IV,Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
1945,Henry IV,5,3.2.113,KING HENRY IV,"Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,"
1946,Henry IV,5,3.2.114,KING HENRY IV,"This infant warrior, in his enterprises"
1947,Henry IV,5,3.2.115,KING HENRY IV,"Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,"
1948,Henry IV,5,3.2.116,KING HENRY IV,"Enlarged him and made a friend of him,"
1949,Henry IV,5,3.2.117,KING HENRY IV,To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
1950,Henry IV,5,3.2.118,KING HENRY IV,And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
1951,Henry IV,5,3.2.119,KING HENRY IV,"And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,"
1952,Henry IV,5,3.2.120,KING HENRY IV,"The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,"
1953,Henry IV,5,3.2.121,KING HENRY IV,Capitulate against us and are up.
1954,Henry IV,5,3.2.122,KING HENRY IV,But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
1955,Henry IV,5,3.2.123,KING HENRY IV,"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,"
1956,Henry IV,5,3.2.124,KING HENRY IV,Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
1957,Henry IV,5,3.2.125,KING HENRY IV,"Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,"
1958,Henry IV,5,3.2.126,KING HENRY IV,Base inclination and the start of spleen
1959,Henry IV,5,3.2.127,KING HENRY IV,"To fight against me under Percy's pay,"
1960,Henry IV,5,3.2.128,KING HENRY IV,"To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,"
1961,Henry IV,5,3.2.129,KING HENRY IV,To show how much thou art degenerate.
1962,Henry IV,6,3.2.130,PRINCE HENRY,"Do not think so, you shall not find it so:"
1963,Henry IV,6,3.2.131,PRINCE HENRY,And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
1964,Henry IV,6,3.2.132,PRINCE HENRY,Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
1965,Henry IV,6,3.2.133,PRINCE HENRY,I will redeem all this on Percy's head
1966,Henry IV,6,3.2.134,PRINCE HENRY,And in the closing of some glorious day
1967,Henry IV,6,3.2.135,PRINCE HENRY,"Be bold to tell you that I am your son,"
1968,Henry IV,6,3.2.136,PRINCE HENRY,When I will wear a garment all of blood
1969,Henry IV,6,3.2.137,PRINCE HENRY,"And stain my favours in a bloody mask,"
1970,Henry IV,6,3.2.138,PRINCE HENRY,"Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:"
1971,Henry IV,6,3.2.139,PRINCE HENRY,"And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,"
1972,Henry IV,6,3.2.140,PRINCE HENRY,"That this same child of honour and renown,"
1973,Henry IV,6,3.2.141,PRINCE HENRY,"This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,"
1974,Henry IV,6,3.2.142,PRINCE HENRY,And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
1975,Henry IV,6,3.2.143,PRINCE HENRY,"For every honour sitting on his helm,"
1976,Henry IV,6,3.2.144,PRINCE HENRY,"Would they were multitudes, and on my head"
1977,Henry IV,6,3.2.145,PRINCE HENRY,"My shames redoubled! for the time will come,"
1978,Henry IV,6,3.2.146,PRINCE HENRY,That I shall make this northern youth exchange
1979,Henry IV,6,3.2.147,PRINCE HENRY,His glorious deeds for my indignities.
1980,Henry IV,6,3.2.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Percy is but my factor, good my lord,"
1981,Henry IV,6,3.2.149,PRINCE HENRY,"To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf,"
1982,Henry IV,6,3.2.150,PRINCE HENRY,"And I will call him to so strict account,"
1983,Henry IV,6,3.2.151,PRINCE HENRY,"That he shall render every glory up,"
1984,Henry IV,6,3.2.152,PRINCE HENRY,"Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,"
1985,Henry IV,6,3.2.153,PRINCE HENRY,Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
1986,Henry IV,6,3.2.154,PRINCE HENRY,"This, in the name of God, I promise here:"
1987,Henry IV,6,3.2.155,PRINCE HENRY,"The which if He be pleased I shall perform,"
1988,Henry IV,6,3.2.156,PRINCE HENRY,I do beseech your majesty may salve
1989,Henry IV,6,3.2.157,PRINCE HENRY,The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
1990,Henry IV,6,3.2.158,PRINCE HENRY,"If not, the end of life cancels all bands,"
1991,Henry IV,6,3.2.159,PRINCE HENRY,And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
1992,Henry IV,6,3.2.160,PRINCE HENRY,Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
1993,Henry IV,7,3.2.161,KING HENRY IV,A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
1994,Henry IV,7,3.2.162,KING HENRY IV,Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
1995,Henry IV,7,,KING HENRY IV,Enter BLUNT
1996,Henry IV,7,3.2.163,KING HENRY IV,"How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed."
1997,Henry IV,8,3.2.164,SIR WALTER BLUNT,So hath the business that I come to speak of.

2001,Henry IV,8,3.2.168,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"A mighty and a fearful head they are,"
2002,Henry IV,8,3.2.169,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"If promises be kept on every hand,"
2003,Henry IV,8,3.2.170,SIR WALTER BLUNT,As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
2004,Henry IV,9,3.2.171,KING HENRY IV,"The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day,"
2005,Henry IV,9,3.2.172,KING HENRY IV,"With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,"

2007,Henry IV,9,3.2.174,KING HENRY IV,"On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,"
2008,Henry IV,9,3.2.175,KING HENRY IV,On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting

2012,Henry IV,9,3.2.179,KING HENRY IV,Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
2013,Henry IV,9,3.2.180,KING HENRY IV,"Our hands are full of business: let's away,"

2018,Henry IV,11,3.2.183,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last"
2019,Henry IV,11,3.2.184,FALSTAFF,action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
2020,Henry IV,11,3.2.185,FALSTAFF,skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
2021,Henry IV,11,3.2.186,FALSTAFF,"gown, I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,"
2022,Henry IV,11,3.2.187,FALSTAFF,"I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some"
2023,Henry IV,11,3.2.188,FALSTAFF,"liking, I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I"
2024,Henry IV,11,3.2.189,FALSTAFF,shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
2025,Henry IV,11,3.2.190,FALSTAFF,"forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I"
2026,Henry IV,11,3.2.191,FALSTAFF,"am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a"
2027,Henry IV,11,3.2.192,FALSTAFF,"church! Company, villanous company, hath been the"
2028,Henry IV,11,3.2.193,FALSTAFF,spoil of me.
2029,Henry IV,12,3.2.194,BARDOLPH,"Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long."
2030,Henry IV,13,3.2.195,FALSTAFF,"Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song, make"
2031,Henry IV,13,3.2.196,FALSTAFF,me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
2032,Henry IV,13,3.2.197,FALSTAFF,"need to be, virtuous enough, swore little, diced not"
2033,Henry IV,13,3.2.198,FALSTAFF,"above seven times a week, went to a bawdy-house once"
2034,Henry IV,13,3.2.199,FALSTAFF,"in a quarter--of an hour, paid money that I"
2035,Henry IV,13,3.2.200,FALSTAFF,"borrowed, three of four times, lived well and in"
2036,Henry IV,13,3.2.201,FALSTAFF,"good compass: and now I live out of all order, out"
2037,Henry IV,13,3.2.202,FALSTAFF,of all compass.
2038,Henry IV,14,3.2.203,BARDOLPH,"Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs"

2046,Henry IV,17,3.2.211,FALSTAFF,"No, I'll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many"
2047,Henry IV,17,3.2.212,FALSTAFF,a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
2048,Henry IV,17,3.2.213,FALSTAFF,never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
2049,Henry IV,17,3.2.214,FALSTAFF,"Dives that lived in purple, for there he is in his"
2050,Henry IV,17,3.2.215,FALSTAFF,"robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way"
2051,Henry IV,17,3.2.216,FALSTAFF,"given to virtue, I would swear by thy face, my oath"
2052,Henry IV,17,3.2.217,FALSTAFF,"should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but"
2053,Henry IV,17,3.2.218,FALSTAFF,"thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but"
2054,Henry IV,17,3.2.219,FALSTAFF,"for the light in thy face, the son of utter"

2056,Henry IV,17,3.2.221,FALSTAFF,"night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou"
2057,Henry IV,17,3.2.222,FALSTAFF,"hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,"
2058,Henry IV,17,3.2.223,FALSTAFF,"there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a"
2059,Henry IV,17,3.2.224,FALSTAFF,"perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!"
2060,Henry IV,17,3.2.225,FALSTAFF,Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
2061,Henry IV,17,3.2.226,FALSTAFF,"torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt"
2062,Henry IV,17,3.2.227,FALSTAFF,tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
2063,Henry IV,17,3.2.228,FALSTAFF,drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
2064,Henry IV,17,3.2.229,FALSTAFF,at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
2065,Henry IV,17,3.2.230,FALSTAFF,maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
2066,Henry IV,17,3.2.231,FALSTAFF,"time this two and thirty years, God reward me for"
2067,Henry IV,17,3.2.232,FALSTAFF,it!

2071,Henry IV,19,3.2.235,FALSTAFF,"How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired"
2072,Henry IV,19,3.2.236,FALSTAFF,yet who picked my pocket?
2073,Henry IV,20,3.2.237,Hostess,"Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you"
2074,Henry IV,20,3.2.238,Hostess,"think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,"
2075,Henry IV,20,3.2.239,Hostess,"I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy"
2076,Henry IV,20,3.2.240,Hostess,"by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair"
2077,Henry IV,20,3.2.241,Hostess,was never lost in my house before.
2078,Henry IV,21,3.2.242,FALSTAFF,"Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many"
2079,Henry IV,21,3.2.243,FALSTAFF,"a hair, and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go"
2080,Henry IV,21,3.2.244,FALSTAFF,"to, you are a woman, go."
2081,Henry IV,22,3.2.245,Hostess,"Who, I? no, I defy thee: God's light, I was never"
2082,Henry IV,22,3.2.246,Hostess,called so in mine own house before.
2083,Henry IV,23,3.2.247,FALSTAFF,"Go to, I know you well enough."
2084,Henry IV,24,3.2.248,Hostess,"No, Sir John, You do not know me, Sir John. I know"
2085,Henry IV,24,3.2.249,Hostess,"you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John, and now"
2086,Henry IV,24,3.2.250,Hostess,you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
2087,Henry IV,24,3.2.251,Hostess,you a dozen of shirts to your back.
2088,Henry IV,25,3.2.252,FALSTAFF,"Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to"
2089,Henry IV,25,3.2.253,FALSTAFF,"bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them."
2090,Henry IV,26,3.2.254,Hostess,"Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight"
2091,Henry IV,26,3.2.255,Hostess,"shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir"
2092,Henry IV,26,3.2.256,Hostess,"John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent"
2093,Henry IV,26,3.2.257,Hostess,"you, four and twenty pound."
2094,Henry IV,27,3.2.258,FALSTAFF,"He had his part of it, let him pay."
2095,Henry IV,28,3.2.259,Hostess,"He? alas, he is poor, he hath nothing."
2096,Henry IV,29,3.2.260,FALSTAFF,"How! poor? look upon his face, what call you rich?"
2097,Henry IV,29,3.2.261,FALSTAFF,"let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:"
2098,Henry IV,29,3.2.262,FALSTAFF,"Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker"
2099,Henry IV,29,3.2.263,FALSTAFF,of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
2100,Henry IV,29,3.2.264,FALSTAFF,shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
2101,Henry IV,29,3.2.265,FALSTAFF,seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
2102,Henry IV,30,3.2.266,Hostess,"O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not"
2103,Henry IV,30,3.2.267,Hostess,"how oft, that ring was copper!"
2104,Henry IV,31,3.2.268,FALSTAFF,"How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an"
2105,Henry IV,31,3.2.269,FALSTAFF,"he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he"
2106,Henry IV,31,3.2.270,FALSTAFF,would say so.
2107,Henry IV,31,,FALSTAFF,"Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF meets them playing on his truncheon like a life"
2108,Henry IV,31,3.2.271,FALSTAFF,"How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?"
2109,Henry IV,31,3.2.272,FALSTAFF,must we all march?
2110,Henry IV,32,3.2.273,BARDOLPH,"Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion."
2111,Henry IV,33,3.2.274,Hostess,"My lord, I pray you, hear me."
2112,Henry IV,34,3.2.275,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy"
2113,Henry IV,34,3.2.276,PRINCE HENRY,"husband? I love him well, he is an honest man."
2114,Henry IV,35,3.2.277,Hostess,"Good my lord, hear me."
2115,Henry IV,36,3.2.278,FALSTAFF,"Prithee, let her alone, and list to me."
2116,Henry IV,37,3.2.279,PRINCE HENRY,"What sayest thou, Jack?"
2117,Henry IV,38,3.2.280,FALSTAFF,The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
2118,Henry IV,38,3.2.281,FALSTAFF,and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
2119,Henry IV,38,3.2.282,FALSTAFF,"bawdy-house, they pick pockets."
2120,Henry IV,39,3.2.283,PRINCE HENRY,"What didst thou lose, Jack?"
2121,Henry IV,40,3.2.284,FALSTAFF,"Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of"
2122,Henry IV,40,3.2.285,FALSTAFF,"forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my"
2123,Henry IV,40,3.2.286,FALSTAFF,grandfather's.
2124,Henry IV,41,3.2.287,PRINCE HENRY,"A trifle, some eight-penny matter."
2125,Henry IV,42,3.2.288,Hostess,"So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your"
2126,Henry IV,42,3.2.289,Hostess,"grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely"
2127,Henry IV,42,3.2.290,Hostess,"of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is, and said"
2128,Henry IV,42,3.2.291,Hostess,he would cudgel you.
2129,Henry IV,43,3.2.292,PRINCE HENRY,What! he did not?
2130,Henry IV,44,3.2.293,Hostess,"There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else."
2131,Henry IV,45,3.2.294,FALSTAFF,There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2132,Henry IV,45,3.2.295,FALSTAFF,"prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn"
2133,Henry IV,45,3.2.296,FALSTAFF,"fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the"
2134,Henry IV,45,3.2.297,FALSTAFF,"deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,"
2135,Henry IV,45,3.2.298,FALSTAFF,go
2136,Henry IV,46,3.2.299,Hostess,"Say, what thing? what thing?"
2137,Henry IV,47,3.2.300,FALSTAFF,"What thing! why, a thing to thank God on."
2138,Henry IV,48,3.2.301,Hostess,"I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou"
2139,Henry IV,48,3.2.302,Hostess,"shouldst know it, I am an honest man's wife: and,"
2140,Henry IV,48,3.2.303,Hostess,"setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to"
2141,Henry IV,48,3.2.304,Hostess,call me so.
2142,Henry IV,49,3.2.305,FALSTAFF,"Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say"
2143,Henry IV,49,3.2.306,FALSTAFF,otherwise.
2144,Henry IV,50,3.2.307,Hostess,"Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?"
2145,Henry IV,51,3.2.308,FALSTAFF,"What beast! why, an otter."
2146,Henry IV,52,3.2.309,PRINCE HENRY,"An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?"
2147,Henry IV,53,3.2.310,FALSTAFF,"Why, she's neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not"
2148,Henry IV,53,3.2.311,FALSTAFF,where to have her.
2149,Henry IV,54,3.2.312,Hostess,Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2150,Henry IV,54,3.2.313,Hostess,"man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!"
2151,Henry IV,55,3.2.314,PRINCE HENRY,"Thou sayest true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly."
2152,Henry IV,56,3.2.315,Hostess,"So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you"
2153,Henry IV,56,3.2.316,Hostess,ought him a thousand pound.
2154,Henry IV,57,3.2.317,PRINCE HENRY,"Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?"
2155,Henry IV,58,3.2.318,FALSTAFF,"A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth"
2156,Henry IV,58,3.2.319,FALSTAFF,a million: thou owest me thy love.
2157,Henry IV,59,3.2.320,Hostess,"Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would"
2158,Henry IV,59,3.2.321,Hostess,cudgel you.
2159,Henry IV,60,3.2.322,FALSTAFF,"Did I, Bardolph?"
2160,Henry IV,61,3.2.323,BARDOLPH,"Indeed, Sir John, you said so."
2161,Henry IV,62,3.2.324,FALSTAFF,"Yea, if he said my ring was copper."
2162,Henry IV,63,3.2.325,PRINCE HENRY,I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
2163,Henry IV,64,3.2.326,FALSTAFF,"Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:"
2164,Henry IV,64,3.2.327,FALSTAFF,"but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the"
2165,Henry IV,64,3.2.328,FALSTAFF,roaring of a lion's whelp.
2166,Henry IV,65,3.2.329,PRINCE HENRY,And why not as the lion?
2167,Henry IV,66,3.2.330,FALSTAFF,The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
2168,Henry IV,66,3.2.331,FALSTAFF,"think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an"
2169,Henry IV,66,3.2.332,FALSTAFF,"I do, I pray God my girdle break."
2170,Henry IV,67,3.2.333,PRINCE HENRY,"O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy"
2171,Henry IV,67,3.2.334,PRINCE HENRY,"knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,"
2172,Henry IV,67,3.2.335,PRINCE HENRY,"truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine, it is all"
2173,Henry IV,67,3.2.336,PRINCE HENRY,filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
2174,Henry IV,67,3.2.337,PRINCE HENRY,"woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,"
2175,Henry IV,67,3.2.338,PRINCE HENRY,"impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in"
2176,Henry IV,67,3.2.339,PRINCE HENRY,"thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of"
2177,Henry IV,67,3.2.340,PRINCE HENRY,"bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of"
2178,Henry IV,67,3.2.341,PRINCE HENRY,"sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket"
2179,Henry IV,67,3.2.342,PRINCE HENRY,"were enriched with any other injuries but these, I"
2180,Henry IV,67,3.2.343,PRINCE HENRY,"am a villain: and yet you will stand to if, you will"
2181,Henry IV,67,3.2.344,PRINCE HENRY,not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
2182,Henry IV,68,3.2.345,FALSTAFF,"Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of"
2183,Henry IV,68,3.2.346,FALSTAFF,"innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack"
2184,Henry IV,68,3.2.347,FALSTAFF,Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
2185,Henry IV,68,3.2.348,FALSTAFF,"have more flesh than another man, and therefore more"
2186,Henry IV,68,3.2.349,FALSTAFF,"frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?"
2187,Henry IV,69,3.2.350,PRINCE HENRY,It appears so by the story.
2188,Henry IV,70,3.2.351,FALSTAFF,"Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast,"
2189,Henry IV,70,3.2.352,FALSTAFF,"love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy"
2190,Henry IV,70,3.2.353,FALSTAFF,guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
2191,Henry IV,70,3.2.354,FALSTAFF,"reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,"
2192,Henry IV,70,3.2.355,FALSTAFF,"prithee, be gone."
2193,Henry IV,70,,FALSTAFF,Exit Hostess
2194,Henry IV,70,3.2.356,FALSTAFF,"Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,"
2195,Henry IV,70,3.2.357,FALSTAFF,"lad, how is that answered?"
2196,Henry IV,71,3.2.358,PRINCE HENRY,"O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to"
2197,Henry IV,71,3.2.359,PRINCE HENRY,thee: the money is paid back again.
2198,Henry IV,72,3.2.360,FALSTAFF,"O, I do not like that paying back, 'tis a double labour."
2199,Henry IV,73,3.2.361,PRINCE HENRY,I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
2200,Henry IV,74,3.2.362,FALSTAFF,"Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and"
2201,Henry IV,74,3.2.363,FALSTAFF,do it with unwashed hands too.
2202,Henry IV,75,3.2.364,BARDOLPH,"Do, my lord."
2203,Henry IV,76,3.2.365,PRINCE HENRY,"I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot."
2204,Henry IV,77,3.2.366,FALSTAFF,I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
2205,Henry IV,77,3.2.367,FALSTAFF,"one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the"
2206,Henry IV,77,3.2.368,FALSTAFF,age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
2207,Henry IV,77,3.2.369,FALSTAFF,"heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for"
2208,Henry IV,77,3.2.370,FALSTAFF,"these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I"
2209,Henry IV,77,3.2.371,FALSTAFF,"laud them, I praise them."
2210,Henry IV,78,3.2.372,PRINCE HENRY,Bardolph!
2211,Henry IV,79,3.2.373,BARDOLPH,My lord?
2212,Henry IV,80,3.2.374,PRINCE HENRY,"Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my"
2213,Henry IV,80,3.2.375,PRINCE HENRY,"brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland."
2214,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Bardolph
2215,Henry IV,80,3.2.376,PRINCE HENRY,"Go, Peto, to horse, to horse, for thou and I have"
2216,Henry IV,80,3.2.377,PRINCE HENRY,thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
2217,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit Peto
2218,Henry IV,80,3.2.378,PRINCE HENRY,"Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two"
2219,Henry IV,80,3.2.379,PRINCE HENRY,o'clock in the afternoon.
2220,Henry IV,80,3.2.380,PRINCE HENRY,"There shalt thou know thy charge, and there receive"
2221,Henry IV,80,3.2.381,PRINCE HENRY,Money and order for their furniture.
2222,Henry IV,80,3.2.382,PRINCE HENRY,"The land is burning, Percy stands on high,"
2223,Henry IV,80,3.2.383,PRINCE HENRY,And either we or they must lower lie.
2224,Henry IV,80,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
2225,Henry IV,81,3.2.384,FALSTAFF,"Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!"
2226,Henry IV,81,3.2.385,FALSTAFF,"O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!"
2227,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,Exit
2228,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,ACT IV
2229,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,SCENE I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2230,Henry IV,81,,FALSTAFF,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS"
2231,Henry IV,1,4.1.1,HOTSPUR,"Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth"
2232,Henry IV,1,4.1.2,HOTSPUR,"In this fine age were not thought flattery,"
2233,Henry IV,1,4.1.3,HOTSPUR,"Such attribution should the Douglas have,"
2234,Henry IV,1,4.1.4,HOTSPUR,As not a soldier of this season's stamp
2235,Henry IV,1,4.1.5,HOTSPUR,Should go so general current through the world.
2236,Henry IV,1,4.1.6,HOTSPUR,"By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy"
2237,Henry IV,1,4.1.7,HOTSPUR,"The tongues of soothers, but a braver place"
2238,Henry IV,1,4.1.8,HOTSPUR,In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
2239,Henry IV,1,4.1.9,HOTSPUR,"Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord."
2240,Henry IV,2,4.1.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Thou art the king of honour:
2241,Henry IV,2,4.1.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,No man so potent breathes upon the ground
2242,Henry IV,2,4.1.12,EARL OF DOUGLAS,But I will beard him.
2243,Henry IV,3,4.1.13,HOTSPUR,"Do so, and 'tis well."
2244,Henry IV,3,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Messenger with letters
2245,Henry IV,3,4.1.14,HOTSPUR,What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
2246,Henry IV,4,4.1.15,Messenger,These letters come from your father.
2247,Henry IV,5,4.1.16,HOTSPUR,Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
2248,Henry IV,6,4.1.17,Messenger,"He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick."
2249,Henry IV,7,4.1.18,HOTSPUR,'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
2250,Henry IV,7,4.1.19,HOTSPUR,In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
2251,Henry IV,7,4.1.20,HOTSPUR,Under whose government come they along?
2252,Henry IV,8,4.1.21,Messenger,"His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord."
2253,Henry IV,9,4.1.22,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?"
2254,Henry IV,10,4.1.23,Messenger,"He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,"
2255,Henry IV,10,4.1.24,Messenger,And at the time of my departure thence
2256,Henry IV,10,4.1.25,Messenger,He was much fear'd by his physicians.
2257,Henry IV,11,4.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,I would the state of time had first been whole
2258,Henry IV,11,4.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,Ere he by sickness had been visited:
2259,Henry IV,11,4.1.28,EARL OF WORCESTER,His health was never better worth than now.
2260,Henry IV,12,4.1.29,HOTSPUR,Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
2261,Henry IV,12,4.1.30,HOTSPUR,"The very life-blood of our enterprise,"
2262,Henry IV,12,4.1.31,HOTSPUR,"'Tis catching hither, even to our camp."
2263,Henry IV,12,4.1.32,HOTSPUR,"He writes me here, that inward sickness--"
2264,Henry IV,12,4.1.33,HOTSPUR,And that his friends by deputation could not
2265,Henry IV,12,4.1.34,HOTSPUR,"So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet"
2266,Henry IV,12,4.1.35,HOTSPUR,To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
2267,Henry IV,12,4.1.36,HOTSPUR,On any soul removed but on his own.
2268,Henry IV,12,4.1.37,HOTSPUR,"Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,"
2269,Henry IV,12,4.1.38,HOTSPUR,"That with our small conjunction we should on,"
2270,Henry IV,12,4.1.39,HOTSPUR,"To see how fortune is disposed to us,"
2271,Henry IV,12,4.1.40,HOTSPUR,"For, as he writes, there is no quailing now."
2272,Henry IV,12,4.1.41,HOTSPUR,Because the king is certainly possess'd
2273,Henry IV,12,4.1.42,HOTSPUR,Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
2274,Henry IV,13,4.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
2275,Henry IV,14,4.1.44,HOTSPUR,"A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:"
2276,Henry IV,14,4.1.45,HOTSPUR,"And yet, in faith, it is not, his present want"
2277,Henry IV,14,4.1.46,HOTSPUR,Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
2278,Henry IV,14,4.1.47,HOTSPUR,To set the exact wealth of all our states
2279,Henry IV,14,4.1.48,HOTSPUR,All at one cast? to set so rich a main
2280,Henry IV,14,4.1.49,HOTSPUR,On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
2281,Henry IV,14,4.1.50,HOTSPUR,"It were not good, for therein should we read"
2282,Henry IV,14,4.1.51,HOTSPUR,"The very bottom and the soul of hope,"
2283,Henry IV,14,4.1.52,HOTSPUR,"The very list, the very utmost bound"
2284,Henry IV,14,4.1.53,HOTSPUR,Of all our fortunes.
2285,Henry IV,15,4.1.54,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"'Faith, and so we should,"
2286,Henry IV,15,4.1.55,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Where now remains a sweet reversion:
2287,Henry IV,15,4.1.56,EARL OF DOUGLAS,We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
2288,Henry IV,15,4.1.57,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Is to come in:
2289,Henry IV,15,4.1.58,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A comfort of retirement lives in this.
2290,Henry IV,16,4.1.59,HOTSPUR,"A rendezvous, a home to fly unto."
2291,Henry IV,16,4.1.60,HOTSPUR,If that the devil and mischance look big
2292,Henry IV,16,4.1.61,HOTSPUR,Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
2293,Henry IV,17,4.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,But yet I would your father had been here.
2294,Henry IV,17,4.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,The quality and hair of our attempt
2295,Henry IV,17,4.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,Brooks no division: it will be thought
2296,Henry IV,17,4.1.65,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By some, that know not why he is away,"
2297,Henry IV,17,4.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike"
2298,Henry IV,17,4.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
2299,Henry IV,17,4.1.68,EARL OF WORCESTER,And think how such an apprehension
2300,Henry IV,17,4.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,May turn the tide of fearful faction
2301,Henry IV,17,4.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And breed a kind of question in our cause,"
2302,Henry IV,17,4.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,For well you know we of the offering side
2303,Henry IV,17,4.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,"
2304,Henry IV,17,4.1.73,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence"
2305,Henry IV,17,4.1.74,EARL OF WORCESTER,The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
2306,Henry IV,17,4.1.75,EARL OF WORCESTER,"This absence of your father's draws a curtain,"
2307,Henry IV,17,4.1.76,EARL OF WORCESTER,That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
2308,Henry IV,17,4.1.77,EARL OF WORCESTER,Before not dreamt of.
2309,Henry IV,18,4.1.78,HOTSPUR,You strain too far.
2310,Henry IV,18,4.1.79,HOTSPUR,I rather of his absence make this use:
2311,Henry IV,18,4.1.80,HOTSPUR,"It lends a lustre and more great opinion,"
2312,Henry IV,18,4.1.81,HOTSPUR,"A larger dare to our great enterprise,"
2313,Henry IV,18,4.1.82,HOTSPUR,"Than if the earl were here, for men must think,"
2314,Henry IV,18,4.1.83,HOTSPUR,If we without his help can make a head
2315,Henry IV,18,4.1.84,HOTSPUR,"To push against a kingdom, with his help"
2316,Henry IV,18,4.1.85,HOTSPUR,We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
2317,Henry IV,18,4.1.86,HOTSPUR,"Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole."
2318,Henry IV,19,4.1.87,EARL OF DOUGLAS,As heart can think: there is not such a word
2319,Henry IV,19,4.1.88,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
2320,Henry IV,19,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON
2321,Henry IV,20,4.1.89,HOTSPUR,"My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul."
2322,Henry IV,21,4.1.90,VERNON,"Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord."
2323,Henry IV,21,4.1.91,VERNON,"The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,"
2324,Henry IV,21,4.1.92,VERNON,"Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John."
2325,Henry IV,22,4.1.93,HOTSPUR,No harm: what more?
2326,Henry IV,23,4.1.94,VERNON,"And further, I have learn'd,"
2327,Henry IV,23,4.1.95,VERNON,"The king himself in person is set forth,"
2328,Henry IV,23,4.1.96,VERNON,"Or hitherwards intended speedily,"
2329,Henry IV,23,4.1.97,VERNON,With strong and mighty preparation.
2330,Henry IV,24,4.1.98,HOTSPUR,"He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,"
2331,Henry IV,24,4.1.99,HOTSPUR,"The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,"
2332,Henry IV,24,4.1.100,HOTSPUR,"And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,"
2333,Henry IV,24,4.1.101,HOTSPUR,And bid it pass?
2334,Henry IV,25,4.1.102,VERNON,"All furnish'd, all in arms,"
2335,Henry IV,25,4.1.103,VERNON,All plumed like estridges that with the wind
2336,Henry IV,25,4.1.104,VERNON,"Baited like eagles having lately bathed,"
2337,Henry IV,25,4.1.105,VERNON,"Glittering in golden coats, like images,"
2338,Henry IV,25,4.1.106,VERNON,"As full of spirit as the month of May,"
2339,Henry IV,25,4.1.107,VERNON,"And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer,"
2340,Henry IV,25,4.1.108,VERNON,"Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls."
2341,Henry IV,25,4.1.109,VERNON,"I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,"
2342,Henry IV,25,4.1.110,VERNON,"His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd"
2343,Henry IV,25,4.1.111,VERNON,"Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,"
2344,Henry IV,25,4.1.112,VERNON,"And vaulted with such ease into his seat,"
2345,Henry IV,25,4.1.113,VERNON,"As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,"
2346,Henry IV,25,4.1.114,VERNON,To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
2347,Henry IV,25,4.1.115,VERNON,And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
2348,Henry IV,26,4.1.116,HOTSPUR,"No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,"
2349,Henry IV,26,4.1.117,HOTSPUR,This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
2350,Henry IV,26,4.1.118,HOTSPUR,"They come like sacrifices in their trim,"
2351,Henry IV,26,4.1.119,HOTSPUR,And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
2352,Henry IV,26,4.1.120,HOTSPUR,All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
2353,Henry IV,26,4.1.121,HOTSPUR,The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
2354,Henry IV,26,4.1.122,HOTSPUR,Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
2355,Henry IV,26,4.1.123,HOTSPUR,To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
2356,Henry IV,26,4.1.124,HOTSPUR,"And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,"
2357,Henry IV,26,4.1.125,HOTSPUR,Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
2358,Henry IV,26,4.1.126,HOTSPUR,Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
2359,Henry IV,26,4.1.127,HOTSPUR,"Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,"
2360,Henry IV,26,4.1.128,HOTSPUR,Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
2361,Henry IV,26,4.1.129,HOTSPUR,O that Glendower were come!
2362,Henry IV,27,4.1.130,VERNON,There is more news:
2363,Henry IV,27,4.1.131,VERNON,"I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,"
2364,Henry IV,27,4.1.132,VERNON,He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
2365,Henry IV,28,4.1.133,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
2366,Henry IV,29,4.1.134,WORCESTER,"Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound."
2367,Henry IV,30,4.1.135,HOTSPUR,What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
2368,Henry IV,31,4.1.136,VERNON,To thirty thousand.
2369,Henry IV,32,4.1.137,HOTSPUR,Forty let it be:
2370,Henry IV,32,4.1.138,HOTSPUR,"My father and Glendower being both away,"
2371,Henry IV,32,4.1.139,HOTSPUR,The powers of us may serve so great a day
2372,Henry IV,32,4.1.140,HOTSPUR,"Come, let us take a muster speedily:"
2373,Henry IV,32,4.1.141,HOTSPUR,"Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily."
2374,Henry IV,33,4.1.142,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
2375,Henry IV,33,4.1.143,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
2376,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Exeunt
2377,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,SCENE II. A public road near Coventry.
2378,Henry IV,33,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH
2379,Henry IV,1,4.2.1,FALSTAFF,"Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry, fill me a"
2380,Henry IV,1,4.2.2,FALSTAFF,"bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through,"
2381,Henry IV,1,4.2.3,FALSTAFF,we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
2382,Henry IV,2,4.2.4,BARDOLPH,"Will you give me money, captain?"
2383,Henry IV,3,4.2.5,FALSTAFF,"Lay out, lay out."
2384,Henry IV,4,4.2.6,BARDOLPH,This bottle makes an angel.
2385,Henry IV,5,4.2.7,FALSTAFF,"An if it do, take it for thy labour, and if it make"
2386,Henry IV,5,4.2.8,FALSTAFF,"twenty, take them all, I'll answer the coinage. Bid"
2387,Henry IV,5,4.2.9,FALSTAFF,my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
2388,Henry IV,6,4.2.10,BARDOLPH,"I will, captain: farewell."
2389,Henry IV,6,,BARDOLPH,Exit
2390,Henry IV,7,4.2.11,FALSTAFF,"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused"
2391,Henry IV,7,4.2.12,FALSTAFF,gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
2392,Henry IV,7,4.2.13,FALSTAFF,"I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty"
2393,Henry IV,7,4.2.14,FALSTAFF,"soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me"
2394,Henry IV,7,4.2.15,FALSTAFF,"none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons, inquire"
2395,Henry IV,7,4.2.16,FALSTAFF,"me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked"
2396,Henry IV,7,4.2.17,FALSTAFF,"twice on the banns, such a commodity of warm slaves,"
2397,Henry IV,7,4.2.18,FALSTAFF,"as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum, such as"
2398,Henry IV,7,4.2.19,FALSTAFF,fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
2399,Henry IV,7,4.2.20,FALSTAFF,fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
2400,Henry IV,7,4.2.21,FALSTAFF,"toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no"
2401,Henry IV,7,4.2.22,FALSTAFF,"bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out"
2402,Henry IV,7,4.2.23,FALSTAFF,"their services, and now my whole charge consists of"
2403,Henry IV,7,4.2.24,FALSTAFF,"ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of"
2404,Henry IV,7,4.2.25,FALSTAFF,"companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the"
2405,Henry IV,7,4.2.26,FALSTAFF,"painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his"
2406,Henry IV,7,4.2.27,FALSTAFF,"sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but"
2407,Henry IV,7,4.2.28,FALSTAFF,"discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to"
2408,Henry IV,7,4.2.29,FALSTAFF,"younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers"
2409,Henry IV,7,4.2.30,FALSTAFF,"trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a"
2410,Henry IV,7,4.2.31,FALSTAFF,"long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than"
2411,Henry IV,7,4.2.32,FALSTAFF,"an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up"
2412,Henry IV,7,4.2.33,FALSTAFF,the rooms of them that have bought out their
2413,Henry IV,7,4.2.34,FALSTAFF,"services, that you would think that I had a hundred"
2414,Henry IV,7,4.2.35,FALSTAFF,and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
2415,Henry IV,7,4.2.36,FALSTAFF,"swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad"
2416,Henry IV,7,4.2.37,FALSTAFF,fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
2417,Henry IV,7,4.2.38,FALSTAFF,all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
2418,Henry IV,7,4.2.39,FALSTAFF,hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
2419,Henry IV,7,4.2.40,FALSTAFF,"Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the"
2420,Henry IV,7,4.2.41,FALSTAFF,"villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had"
2421,Henry IV,7,4.2.42,FALSTAFF,"gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of"
2422,Henry IV,7,4.2.43,FALSTAFF,prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
2423,Henry IV,7,4.2.44,FALSTAFF,"company, and the half shirt is two napkins tacked"
2424,Henry IV,7,4.2.45,FALSTAFF,together and thrown over the shoulders like an
2425,Henry IV,7,4.2.46,FALSTAFF,"herald's coat without sleeves, and the shirt, to say"
2426,Henry IV,7,4.2.47,FALSTAFF,"the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or"
2427,Henry IV,7,4.2.48,FALSTAFF,the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
2428,Henry IV,7,4.2.49,FALSTAFF,"one, they'll find linen enough on every hedge."
2429,Henry IV,7,,FALSTAFF,Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND
2430,Henry IV,8,4.2.50,PRINCE HENRY,"How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!"
2431,Henry IV,9,4.2.51,FALSTAFF,"What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou"
2432,Henry IV,9,4.2.52,FALSTAFF,"in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I"
2433,Henry IV,9,4.2.53,FALSTAFF,cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
2434,Henry IV,9,4.2.54,FALSTAFF,at Shrewsbury.
2435,Henry IV,10,4.2.55,WESTMORELAND,"Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were"
2436,Henry IV,10,4.2.56,WESTMORELAND,"there, and you too, but my powers are there already."
2437,Henry IV,10,4.2.57,WESTMORELAND,"The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must"
2438,Henry IV,10,4.2.58,WESTMORELAND,away all night.
2439,Henry IV,11,4.2.59,FALSTAFF,"Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to"
2440,Henry IV,11,4.2.60,FALSTAFF,steal cream.
2441,Henry IV,12,4.2.61,PRINCE HENRY,"I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath"
2442,Henry IV,12,4.2.62,PRINCE HENRY,"already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose"
2443,Henry IV,12,4.2.63,PRINCE HENRY,fellows are these that come after?
2444,Henry IV,13,4.2.64,FALSTAFF,"Mine, Hal, mine."
2445,Henry IV,14,4.2.65,PRINCE HENRY,I did never see such pitiful rascals.
2446,Henry IV,15,4.2.66,FALSTAFF,"Tut, tut, good enough to toss, food for powder, food"
2447,Henry IV,15,4.2.67,FALSTAFF,"for powder, they'll fill a pit as well as better:"
2448,Henry IV,15,4.2.68,FALSTAFF,"tush, man, mortal men, mortal men."
2449,Henry IV,16,4.2.69,WESTMORELAND,"Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor"
2450,Henry IV,16,4.2.70,WESTMORELAND,"and bare, too beggarly."
2451,Henry IV,17,4.2.71,FALSTAFF,"'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had"
2452,Henry IV,17,4.2.72,FALSTAFF,"that, and for their bareness, I am sure they never"
2453,Henry IV,17,4.2.73,FALSTAFF,learned that of me.
2454,Henry IV,18,4.2.74,PRINCE HENRY,"No I'll be sworn, unless you call three fingers on"
2455,Henry IV,18,4.2.75,PRINCE HENRY,"the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is"
2456,Henry IV,18,4.2.76,PRINCE HENRY,already in the field.
2457,Henry IV,19,4.2.77,FALSTAFF,"What, is the king encamped?"
2458,Henry IV,20,4.2.78,WESTMORELAND,"He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long."
2459,Henry IV,21,4.2.79,FALSTAFF,"Well,"
2460,Henry IV,21,4.2.80,FALSTAFF,To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
2461,Henry IV,21,4.2.81,FALSTAFF,Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.
2462,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,Exeunt
2463,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,SCENE III. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
2464,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,"Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON"
2465,Henry IV,1,4.3.1,HOTSPUR,We'll fight with him to-night.
2466,Henry IV,2,4.3.2,EARL OF WORCESTER,It may not be.
2467,Henry IV,3,4.3.3,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You give him then the advantage.
2468,Henry IV,4,4.3.4,VERNON,Not a whit.
2469,Henry IV,5,4.3.5,HOTSPUR,Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
2470,Henry IV,6,4.3.6,VERNON,So do we.
2471,Henry IV,7,4.3.7,HOTSPUR,"His is certain, ours is doubtful."
2472,Henry IV,8,4.3.8,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Good cousin, be advised, stir not tonight."
2473,Henry IV,9,4.3.9,VERNON,"Do not, my lord."
2474,Henry IV,10,4.3.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You do not counsel well:
2475,Henry IV,10,4.3.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
2476,Henry IV,11,4.3.12,VERNON,"Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,"
2477,Henry IV,11,4.3.13,VERNON,"And I dare well maintain it with my life,"
2478,Henry IV,11,4.3.14,VERNON,"If well-respected honour bid me on,"
2479,Henry IV,11,4.3.15,VERNON,I hold as little counsel with weak fear
2480,Henry IV,11,4.3.16,VERNON,"As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:"
2481,Henry IV,11,4.3.17,VERNON,Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
2482,Henry IV,11,4.3.18,VERNON,Which of us fears.
2483,Henry IV,12,4.3.19,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Yea, or to-night."
2484,Henry IV,13,4.3.20,VERNON,Content.
2485,Henry IV,14,4.3.21,HOTSPUR,"To-night, say I."
2486,Henry IV,15,4.3.22,VERNON,"Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,"
2487,Henry IV,15,4.3.23,VERNON,"Being men of such great leading as you are,"
2488,Henry IV,15,4.3.24,VERNON,That you foresee not what impediments
2489,Henry IV,15,4.3.25,VERNON,Drag back our expedition: certain horse
2490,Henry IV,15,4.3.26,VERNON,Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
2491,Henry IV,15,4.3.27,VERNON,"Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today,"
2492,Henry IV,15,4.3.28,VERNON,"And now their pride and mettle is asleep,"
2493,Henry IV,15,4.3.29,VERNON,"Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,"
2494,Henry IV,15,4.3.30,VERNON,That not a horse is half the half of himself.
2495,Henry IV,16,4.3.31,HOTSPUR,So are the horses of the enemy
2496,Henry IV,16,4.3.32,HOTSPUR,"In general, journey-bated and brought low:"
2497,Henry IV,16,4.3.33,HOTSPUR,The better part of ours are full of rest.
2498,Henry IV,17,4.3.34,EARL OF WORCESTER,The number of the king exceedeth ours:
2499,Henry IV,17,4.3.35,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in."
2500,Henry IV,17,,EARL OF WORCESTER,The trumpet sounds a parley
2501,Henry IV,17,,EARL OF WORCESTER,Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT
2502,Henry IV,18,4.3.36,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I come with gracious offers from the king,"
2503,Henry IV,18,4.3.37,SIR WALTER BLUNT,if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
2504,Henry IV,19,4.3.38,HOTSPUR,"Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt, and would to God"
2505,Henry IV,19,4.3.39,HOTSPUR,You were of our determination!
2506,Henry IV,19,4.3.40,HOTSPUR,"Some of us love you well, and even those some"
2507,Henry IV,19,4.3.41,HOTSPUR,"Envy your great deservings and good name,"
2508,Henry IV,19,4.3.42,HOTSPUR,"Because you are not of our quality,"
2509,Henry IV,19,4.3.43,HOTSPUR,But stand against us like an enemy.
2510,Henry IV,20,4.3.44,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"And God defend but still I should stand so,"
2511,Henry IV,20,4.3.45,SIR WALTER BLUNT,So long as out of limit and true rule
2512,Henry IV,20,4.3.46,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You stand against anointed majesty.
2513,Henry IV,20,4.3.47,SIR WALTER BLUNT,But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
2514,Henry IV,20,4.3.48,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"The nature of your griefs, and whereupon"
2515,Henry IV,20,4.3.49,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You conjure from the breast of civil peace
2516,Henry IV,20,4.3.50,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land"
2517,Henry IV,20,4.3.51,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Audacious cruelty. If that the king
2518,Henry IV,20,4.3.52,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Have any way your good deserts forgot,"
2519,Henry IV,20,4.3.53,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Which he confesseth to be manifold,"
2520,Henry IV,20,4.3.54,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed"
2521,Henry IV,20,4.3.55,SIR WALTER BLUNT,You shall have your desires with interest
2522,Henry IV,20,4.3.56,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And pardon absolute for yourself and these
2523,Henry IV,20,4.3.57,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Herein misled by your suggestion.
2524,Henry IV,21,4.3.58,HOTSPUR,"The king is kind, and well we know the king"
2525,Henry IV,21,4.3.59,HOTSPUR,"Knows at what time to promise, when to pay."
2526,Henry IV,21,4.3.60,HOTSPUR,My father and my uncle and myself
2527,Henry IV,21,4.3.61,HOTSPUR,"Did give him that same royalty he wears,"
2528,Henry IV,21,4.3.62,HOTSPUR,"And when he was not six and twenty strong,"
2529,Henry IV,21,4.3.63,HOTSPUR,"Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,"
2530,Henry IV,21,4.3.64,HOTSPUR,"A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,"
2531,Henry IV,21,4.3.65,HOTSPUR,"My father gave him welcome to the shore,"
2532,Henry IV,21,4.3.66,HOTSPUR,And when he heard him swear and vow to God
2533,Henry IV,21,4.3.67,HOTSPUR,"He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,"
2534,Henry IV,21,4.3.68,HOTSPUR,"To sue his livery and beg his peace,"
2535,Henry IV,21,4.3.69,HOTSPUR,"With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,"
2536,Henry IV,21,4.3.70,HOTSPUR,"My father, in kind heart and pity moved,"
2537,Henry IV,21,4.3.71,HOTSPUR,Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
2538,Henry IV,21,4.3.72,HOTSPUR,Now when the lords and barons of the realm
2539,Henry IV,21,4.3.73,HOTSPUR,"Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,"
2540,Henry IV,21,4.3.74,HOTSPUR,"The more and less came in with cap and knee,"
2541,Henry IV,21,4.3.75,HOTSPUR,"Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,"
2542,Henry IV,21,4.3.76,HOTSPUR,"Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,"
2543,Henry IV,21,4.3.77,HOTSPUR,"Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,"
2544,Henry IV,21,4.3.78,HOTSPUR,"Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him"
2545,Henry IV,21,4.3.79,HOTSPUR,Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
2546,Henry IV,21,4.3.80,HOTSPUR,"He presently, as greatness knows itself,"
2547,Henry IV,21,4.3.81,HOTSPUR,Steps me a little higher than his vow
2548,Henry IV,21,4.3.82,HOTSPUR,"Made to my father, while his blood was poor,"
2549,Henry IV,21,4.3.83,HOTSPUR,"Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,"
2550,Henry IV,21,4.3.84,HOTSPUR,"And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform"
2551,Henry IV,21,4.3.85,HOTSPUR,Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
2552,Henry IV,21,4.3.86,HOTSPUR,"That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,"
2553,Henry IV,21,4.3.87,HOTSPUR,"Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep"
2554,Henry IV,21,4.3.88,HOTSPUR,"Over his country's wrongs, and by this face,"
2555,Henry IV,21,4.3.89,HOTSPUR,"This seeming brow of justice, did he win"
2556,Henry IV,21,4.3.90,HOTSPUR,"The hearts of all that he did angle for,"
2557,Henry IV,21,4.3.91,HOTSPUR,"Proceeded further, cut me off the heads"
2558,Henry IV,21,4.3.92,HOTSPUR,Of all the favourites that the absent king
2559,Henry IV,21,4.3.93,HOTSPUR,"In deputation left behind him here,"
2560,Henry IV,21,4.3.94,HOTSPUR,When he was personal in the Irish war.
2561,Henry IV,22,4.3.95,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"Tut, I came not to hear this."
2562,Henry IV,23,4.3.96,HOTSPUR,Then to the point.
2563,Henry IV,23,4.3.97,HOTSPUR,"In short time after, he deposed the king,"
2564,Henry IV,23,4.3.98,HOTSPUR,"Soon after that, deprived him of his life,"
2565,Henry IV,23,4.3.99,HOTSPUR,"And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:"
2566,Henry IV,23,4.3.100,HOTSPUR,"To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,"
2567,Henry IV,23,4.3.101,HOTSPUR,"Who is, if every owner were well placed,"
2568,Henry IV,23,4.3.102,HOTSPUR,"Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,"
2569,Henry IV,23,4.3.103,HOTSPUR,"There without ransom to lie forfeited,"
2570,Henry IV,23,4.3.104,HOTSPUR,"Disgraced me in my happy victories,"
2571,Henry IV,23,4.3.105,HOTSPUR,"Sought to entrap me by intelligence,"
2572,Henry IV,23,4.3.106,HOTSPUR,"Rated mine uncle from the council-board,"
2573,Henry IV,23,4.3.107,HOTSPUR,"In rage dismiss'd my father from the court,"
2574,Henry IV,23,4.3.108,HOTSPUR,"Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,"
2575,Henry IV,23,4.3.109,HOTSPUR,And in conclusion drove us to seek out
2576,Henry IV,23,4.3.110,HOTSPUR,"This head of safety, and withal to pry"
2577,Henry IV,23,4.3.111,HOTSPUR,"Into his title, the which we find"
2578,Henry IV,23,4.3.112,HOTSPUR,Too indirect for long continuance.
2579,Henry IV,24,4.3.113,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Shall I return this answer to the king?
2580,Henry IV,25,4.3.114,HOTSPUR,"Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile."
2581,Henry IV,25,4.3.115,HOTSPUR,"Go to the king, and let there be impawn'd"
2582,Henry IV,25,4.3.116,HOTSPUR,"Some surety for a safe return again,"
2583,Henry IV,25,4.3.117,HOTSPUR,And in the morning early shall my uncle
2584,Henry IV,25,4.3.118,HOTSPUR,Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
2585,Henry IV,26,4.3.119,SIR WALTER BLUNT,I would you would accept of grace and love.
2586,Henry IV,27,4.3.120,HOTSPUR,And may be so we shall.
2587,Henry IV,28,4.3.121,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Pray God you do.
2588,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Exeunt
2589,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,SCENE IV. York. The ARCHBISHOP'S palace.
2590,Henry IV,28,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL
2591,Henry IV,1,4.4.1,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief"
2592,Henry IV,1,4.4.2,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"With winged haste to the lord marshal,"
2593,Henry IV,1,4.4.3,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest"
2594,Henry IV,1,4.4.4,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To whom they are directed. If you knew
2595,Henry IV,1,4.4.5,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"How much they do to import, you would make haste."
2596,Henry IV,2,4.4.6,SIR MICHAEL,"My good lord,"
2597,Henry IV,2,4.4.7,SIR MICHAEL,I guess their tenor.
2598,Henry IV,3,4.4.8,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Like enough you do.
2599,Henry IV,3,4.4.9,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day"
2600,Henry IV,3,4.4.10,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
2601,Henry IV,3,4.4.11,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Must bide the touch, for, sir, at Shrewsbury,"
2602,Henry IV,3,4.4.12,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"As I am truly given to understand,"
2603,Henry IV,3,4.4.13,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The king with mighty and quick-raised power
2604,Henry IV,3,4.4.14,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,"
2605,Henry IV,3,4.4.15,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"What with the sickness of Northumberland,"
2606,Henry IV,3,4.4.16,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Whose power was in the first proportion,"
2607,Henry IV,3,4.4.17,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,"
2608,Henry IV,3,4.4.18,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Who with them was a rated sinew too
2609,Henry IV,3,4.4.19,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,"
2610,Henry IV,3,4.4.20,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,I fear the power of Percy is too weak
2611,Henry IV,3,4.4.21,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,To wage an instant trial with the king.
2612,Henry IV,4,4.4.22,SIR MICHAEL,"Why, my good lord, you need not fear,"
2613,Henry IV,4,4.4.23,SIR MICHAEL,There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
2614,Henry IV,5,4.4.24,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"No, Mortimer is not there."
2615,Henry IV,6,4.4.25,SIR MICHAEL,"But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,"
2616,Henry IV,6,4.4.26,SIR MICHAEL,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
2617,Henry IV,6,4.4.27,SIR MICHAEL,"Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen."
2618,Henry IV,7,4.4.28,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
2619,Henry IV,7,4.4.29,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,The special head of all the land together:
2620,Henry IV,7,4.4.30,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,"
2621,Henry IV,7,4.4.31,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt,"
2622,Henry IV,7,4.4.32,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And moe corrivals and dear men
2623,Henry IV,7,4.4.33,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Of estimation and command in arms.
2624,Henry IV,8,4.4.34,SIR MICHAEL,"Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed."
2625,Henry IV,9,4.4.35,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear,"
2626,Henry IV,9,4.4.36,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:"
2627,Henry IV,9,4.4.37,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king"
2628,Henry IV,9,4.4.38,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,"
2629,Henry IV,9,4.4.39,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"For he hath heard of our confederacy,"
2630,Henry IV,9,4.4.40,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
2631,Henry IV,9,4.4.41,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Therefore make haste. I must go write again
2632,Henry IV,9,4.4.42,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael."
2633,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,Exeunt

2635,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.
2636,Henry IV,9,,ARCHBISHOP OF YORK,"Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF"
2637,Henry IV,1,5.1.1,KING HENRY IV,How bloodily the sun begins to peer
2638,Henry IV,1,5.1.2,KING HENRY IV,Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
2639,Henry IV,1,5.1.3,KING HENRY IV,At his distemperature.
2640,Henry IV,2,5.1.4,PRINCE HENRY,The southern wind
2641,Henry IV,2,5.1.5,PRINCE HENRY,"Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,"
2642,Henry IV,2,5.1.6,PRINCE HENRY,And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
2643,Henry IV,2,5.1.7,PRINCE HENRY,Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
2644,Henry IV,3,5.1.8,KING HENRY IV,"Then with the losers let it sympathize,"
2645,Henry IV,3,5.1.9,KING HENRY IV,For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
2646,Henry IV,3,,KING HENRY IV,The trumpet sounds
2647,Henry IV,3,,KING HENRY IV,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2648,Henry IV,3,5.1.10,KING HENRY IV,"How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well"
2649,Henry IV,3,5.1.11,KING HENRY IV,That you and I should meet upon such terms
2650,Henry IV,3,5.1.12,KING HENRY IV,"As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,"
2651,Henry IV,3,5.1.13,KING HENRY IV,"And made us doff our easy robes of peace,"
2652,Henry IV,3,5.1.14,KING HENRY IV,To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
2653,Henry IV,3,5.1.15,KING HENRY IV,"This is not well, my lord, this is not well."
2654,Henry IV,3,5.1.16,KING HENRY IV,What say you to it? will you again unknit
2655,Henry IV,3,5.1.17,KING HENRY IV,This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
2656,Henry IV,3,5.1.18,KING HENRY IV,And move in that obedient orb again
2657,Henry IV,3,5.1.19,KING HENRY IV,"Where you did give a fair and natural light,"
2658,Henry IV,3,5.1.20,KING HENRY IV,"And be no more an exhaled meteor,"
2659,Henry IV,3,5.1.21,KING HENRY IV,A prodigy of fear and a portent
2660,Henry IV,3,5.1.22,KING HENRY IV,Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
2661,Henry IV,4,5.1.23,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Hear me, my liege:"
2662,Henry IV,4,5.1.24,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For mine own part, I could be well content"
2663,Henry IV,4,5.1.25,EARL OF WORCESTER,To entertain the lag-end of my life
2664,Henry IV,4,5.1.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,"With quiet hours, for I do protest,"
2665,Henry IV,4,5.1.27,EARL OF WORCESTER,I have not sought the day of this dislike.
2666,Henry IV,5,5.1.28,KING HENRY IV,"You have not sought it! how comes it, then?"
2667,Henry IV,6,5.1.29,FALSTAFF,"Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it."
2668,Henry IV,7,5.1.30,PRINCE HENRY,"Peace, chewet, peace!"
2669,Henry IV,8,5.1.31,EARL OF WORCESTER,It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
2670,Henry IV,8,5.1.32,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of favour from myself and all our house,"
2671,Henry IV,8,5.1.33,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And yet I must remember you, my lord,"
2672,Henry IV,8,5.1.34,EARL OF WORCESTER,We were the first and dearest of your friends.
2673,Henry IV,8,5.1.35,EARL OF WORCESTER,For you my staff of office did I break
2674,Henry IV,8,5.1.36,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In Richard's time, and posted day and night"
2675,Henry IV,8,5.1.37,EARL OF WORCESTER,"to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,"
2676,Henry IV,8,5.1.38,EARL OF WORCESTER,When yet you were in place and in account
2677,Henry IV,8,5.1.39,EARL OF WORCESTER,Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
2678,Henry IV,8,5.1.40,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It was myself, my brother and his son,"
2679,Henry IV,8,5.1.41,EARL OF WORCESTER,That brought you home and boldly did outdare
2680,Henry IV,8,5.1.42,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The dangers of the time. You swore to us,"
2681,Henry IV,8,5.1.43,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,"
2682,Henry IV,8,5.1.44,EARL OF WORCESTER,"That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state,"
2683,Henry IV,8,5.1.45,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,"
2684,Henry IV,8,5.1.46,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:"
2685,Henry IV,8,5.1.47,EARL OF WORCESTER,To this we swore our aid. But in short space
2686,Henry IV,8,5.1.48,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It rain'd down fortune showering on your head,"
2687,Henry IV,8,5.1.49,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And such a flood of greatness fell on you,"
2688,Henry IV,8,5.1.50,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with our help, what with the absent king,"
2689,Henry IV,8,5.1.51,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What with the injuries of a wanton time,"
2690,Henry IV,8,5.1.52,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The seeming sufferances that you had borne,"
2691,Henry IV,8,5.1.53,EARL OF WORCESTER,And the contrarious winds that held the king
2692,Henry IV,8,5.1.54,EARL OF WORCESTER,So long in his unlucky Irish wars
2693,Henry IV,8,5.1.55,EARL OF WORCESTER,That all in England did repute him dead:
2694,Henry IV,8,5.1.56,EARL OF WORCESTER,And from this swarm of fair advantages
2695,Henry IV,8,5.1.57,EARL OF WORCESTER,You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
2696,Henry IV,8,5.1.58,EARL OF WORCESTER,"To gripe the general sway into your hand,"
2697,Henry IV,8,5.1.59,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Forget your oath to us at Doncaster,"
2698,Henry IV,8,5.1.60,EARL OF WORCESTER,And being fed by us you used us so
2699,Henry IV,8,5.1.61,EARL OF WORCESTER,"As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,"
2700,Henry IV,8,5.1.62,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Useth the sparrow, did oppress our nest,"
2701,Henry IV,8,5.1.63,EARL OF WORCESTER,Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
2702,Henry IV,8,5.1.64,EARL OF WORCESTER,That even our love durst not come near your sight
2703,Henry IV,8,5.1.65,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For fear of swallowing, but with nimble wing"
2704,Henry IV,8,5.1.66,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly"
2705,Henry IV,8,5.1.67,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Out of sight and raise this present head,"
2706,Henry IV,8,5.1.68,EARL OF WORCESTER,Whereby we stand opposed by such means
2707,Henry IV,8,5.1.69,EARL OF WORCESTER,As you yourself have forged against yourself
2708,Henry IV,8,5.1.70,EARL OF WORCESTER,"By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,"
2709,Henry IV,8,5.1.71,EARL OF WORCESTER,And violation of all faith and troth
2710,Henry IV,8,5.1.72,EARL OF WORCESTER,Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
2711,Henry IV,9,5.1.73,KING HENRY IV,"These things indeed you have articulate,"
2712,Henry IV,9,5.1.74,KING HENRY IV,"Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,"
2713,Henry IV,9,5.1.75,KING HENRY IV,To face the garment of rebellion
2714,Henry IV,9,5.1.76,KING HENRY IV,With some fine colour that may please the eye
2715,Henry IV,9,5.1.77,KING HENRY IV,"Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,"
2716,Henry IV,9,5.1.78,KING HENRY IV,Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
2717,Henry IV,9,5.1.79,KING HENRY IV,Of hurlyburly innovation:
2718,Henry IV,9,5.1.80,KING HENRY IV,And never yet did insurrection want
2719,Henry IV,9,5.1.81,KING HENRY IV,"Such water-colours to impaint his cause,"
2720,Henry IV,9,5.1.82,KING HENRY IV,"Nor moody beggars, starving for a time"
2721,Henry IV,9,5.1.83,KING HENRY IV,Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
2722,Henry IV,10,5.1.84,PRINCE HENRY,In both your armies there is many a soul
2723,Henry IV,10,5.1.85,PRINCE HENRY,"Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,"
2724,Henry IV,10,5.1.86,PRINCE HENRY,"If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,"
2725,Henry IV,10,5.1.87,PRINCE HENRY,The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
2726,Henry IV,10,5.1.88,PRINCE HENRY,"In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,"
2727,Henry IV,10,5.1.89,PRINCE HENRY,"This present enterprise set off his head,"
2728,Henry IV,10,5.1.90,PRINCE HENRY,"I do not think a braver gentleman,"
2729,Henry IV,10,5.1.91,PRINCE HENRY,"More active-valiant or more valiant-young,"
2730,Henry IV,10,5.1.92,PRINCE HENRY,"More daring or more bold, is now alive"
2731,Henry IV,10,5.1.93,PRINCE HENRY,To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
2732,Henry IV,10,5.1.94,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, I may speak it to my shame,"
2733,Henry IV,10,5.1.95,PRINCE HENRY,"I have a truant been to chivalry,"
2734,Henry IV,10,5.1.96,PRINCE HENRY,"And so I hear he doth account me too,"
2735,Henry IV,10,5.1.97,PRINCE HENRY,Yet this before my father's majesty--
2736,Henry IV,10,5.1.98,PRINCE HENRY,I am content that he shall take the odds
2737,Henry IV,10,5.1.99,PRINCE HENRY,"Of his great name and estimation,"
2738,Henry IV,10,5.1.100,PRINCE HENRY,"And will, to save the blood on either side,"
2739,Henry IV,10,5.1.101,PRINCE HENRY,Try fortune with him in a single fight.
2740,Henry IV,11,5.1.102,KING HENRY IV,"And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,"
2741,Henry IV,11,5.1.103,KING HENRY IV,Albeit considerations infinite
2742,Henry IV,11,5.1.104,KING HENRY IV,"Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,"
2743,Henry IV,11,5.1.105,KING HENRY IV,"We love our people well, even those we love"
2744,Henry IV,11,5.1.106,KING HENRY IV,"That are misled upon your cousin's part,"
2745,Henry IV,11,5.1.107,KING HENRY IV,"And, will they take the offer of our grace,"
2746,Henry IV,11,5.1.108,KING HENRY IV,"Both he and they and you, every man"
2747,Henry IV,11,5.1.109,KING HENRY IV,Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
2748,Henry IV,11,5.1.110,KING HENRY IV,"So tell your cousin, and bring me word"
2749,Henry IV,11,5.1.111,KING HENRY IV,"What he will do: but if he will not yield,"
2750,Henry IV,11,5.1.112,KING HENRY IV,Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
2751,Henry IV,11,5.1.113,KING HENRY IV,"And they shall do their office. So, be gone,"
2752,Henry IV,11,5.1.114,KING HENRY IV,We will not now be troubled with reply:
2753,Henry IV,11,5.1.115,KING HENRY IV,"We offer fair, take it advisedly."
2754,Henry IV,11,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON
2755,Henry IV,12,5.1.116,PRINCE HENRY,"It will not be accepted, on my life:"
2756,Henry IV,12,5.1.117,PRINCE HENRY,The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
2757,Henry IV,12,5.1.118,PRINCE HENRY,Are confident against the world in arms.
2758,Henry IV,13,5.1.119,KING HENRY IV,"Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,"
2759,Henry IV,13,5.1.120,KING HENRY IV,"For, on their answer, will we set on them:"
2760,Henry IV,13,5.1.121,KING HENRY IV,"And God befriend us, as our cause is just!"
2761,Henry IV,13,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF
2762,Henry IV,14,5.1.122,FALSTAFF,"Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride"
2763,Henry IV,14,5.1.123,FALSTAFF,"me, so, 'tis a point of friendship."
2764,Henry IV,15,5.1.124,PRINCE HENRY,Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
2765,Henry IV,15,5.1.125,PRINCE HENRY,"Say thy prayers, and farewell."
2766,Henry IV,16,5.1.126,FALSTAFF,"I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well."
2767,Henry IV,17,5.1.127,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, thou owest God a death."
2768,Henry IV,17,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
2769,Henry IV,18,5.1.128,FALSTAFF,"'Tis not due yet, I would be loath to pay him before"
2770,Henry IV,18,5.1.129,FALSTAFF,his day. What need I be so forward with him that
2771,Henry IV,18,5.1.130,FALSTAFF,"calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter, honour pricks"
2772,Henry IV,18,5.1.131,FALSTAFF,"me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I"
2773,Henry IV,18,5.1.132,FALSTAFF,come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
2774,Henry IV,18,5.1.133,FALSTAFF,an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
2775,Henry IV,18,5.1.134,FALSTAFF,"Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is"
2776,Henry IV,18,5.1.135,FALSTAFF,honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
2777,Henry IV,18,5.1.136,FALSTAFF,is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
2778,Henry IV,18,5.1.137,FALSTAFF,he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
2779,Henry IV,18,5.1.138,FALSTAFF,"Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,"
2780,Henry IV,18,5.1.139,FALSTAFF,to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
2781,Henry IV,18,5.1.140,FALSTAFF,no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
2782,Henry IV,18,5.1.141,FALSTAFF,I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
2783,Henry IV,18,5.1.142,FALSTAFF,ends my catechism.
2784,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,Exit
2785,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,SCENE II. The rebel camp.
2786,Henry IV,18,,FALSTAFF,Enter WORCESTER and VERNON
2787,Henry IV,1,5.2.1,EARL OF WORCESTER,"O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,"
2788,Henry IV,1,5.2.2,EARL OF WORCESTER,The liberal and kind offer of the king.
2789,Henry IV,2,5.2.3,VERNON,'Twere best he did.
2790,Henry IV,3,5.2.4,EARL OF WORCESTER,Then are we all undone.
2791,Henry IV,3,5.2.5,EARL OF WORCESTER,"It is not possible, it cannot be,"
2792,Henry IV,3,5.2.6,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The king should keep his word in loving us,"
2793,Henry IV,3,5.2.7,EARL OF WORCESTER,He will suspect us still and find a time
2794,Henry IV,3,5.2.8,EARL OF WORCESTER,To punish this offence in other faults:
2795,Henry IV,3,5.2.9,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,"
2796,Henry IV,3,5.2.10,EARL OF WORCESTER,"For treason is but trusted like the fox,"
2797,Henry IV,3,5.2.11,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,"
2798,Henry IV,3,5.2.12,EARL OF WORCESTER,Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
2799,Henry IV,3,5.2.13,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Look how we can, or sad or merrily,"
2800,Henry IV,3,5.2.14,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Interpretation will misquote our looks,"
2801,Henry IV,3,5.2.15,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,"
2802,Henry IV,3,5.2.16,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The better cherish'd, still the nearer death."
2803,Henry IV,3,5.2.17,EARL OF WORCESTER,"My nephew's trespass may be well forgot,"
2804,Henry IV,3,5.2.18,EARL OF WORCESTER,"it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,"
2805,Henry IV,3,5.2.19,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And an adopted name of privilege,"
2806,Henry IV,3,5.2.20,EARL OF WORCESTER,"A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:"
2807,Henry IV,3,5.2.21,EARL OF WORCESTER,All his offences live upon my head
2808,Henry IV,3,5.2.22,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And on his father's, we did train him on,"
2809,Henry IV,3,5.2.23,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, his corruption being ta'en from us,"
2810,Henry IV,3,5.2.24,EARL OF WORCESTER,"We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all."
2811,Henry IV,3,5.2.25,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,"
2812,Henry IV,3,5.2.26,EARL OF WORCESTER,"In any case, the offer of the king."
2813,Henry IV,4,5.2.27,VERNON,"Deliver what you will, I'll say 'tis so."
2814,Henry IV,4,5.2.28,VERNON,Here comes your cousin.
2815,Henry IV,4,,VERNON,Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS
2816,Henry IV,5,5.2.29,HOTSPUR,My uncle is return'd:
2817,Henry IV,5,5.2.30,HOTSPUR,Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
2818,Henry IV,5,5.2.31,HOTSPUR,"Uncle, what news?"
2819,Henry IV,6,5.2.32,EARL OF WORCESTER,The king will bid you battle presently.
2820,Henry IV,7,5.2.33,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
2821,Henry IV,8,5.2.34,HOTSPUR,"Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so."
2822,Henry IV,9,5.2.35,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Marry, and shall, and very willingly."
2823,Henry IV,9,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Exit
2824,Henry IV,10,5.2.36,EARL OF WORCESTER,There is no seeming mercy in the king.
2825,Henry IV,11,5.2.37,HOTSPUR,Did you beg any? God forbid!
2826,Henry IV,12,5.2.38,EARL OF WORCESTER,"I told him gently of our grievances,"
2827,Henry IV,12,5.2.39,EARL OF WORCESTER,"Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus,"
2828,Henry IV,12,5.2.40,EARL OF WORCESTER,By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
2829,Henry IV,12,5.2.41,EARL OF WORCESTER,"He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge"
2830,Henry IV,12,5.2.42,EARL OF WORCESTER,With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
2831,Henry IV,12,,EARL OF WORCESTER,Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS
2832,Henry IV,13,5.2.43,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Arm, gentlemen, to arms! for I have thrown"
2833,Henry IV,13,5.2.44,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,"
2834,Henry IV,13,5.2.45,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it,"
2835,Henry IV,13,5.2.46,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
2836,Henry IV,14,5.2.47,EARL OF WORCESTER,"The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,"
2837,Henry IV,14,5.2.48,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And, nephew, challenged you to single fight."
2838,Henry IV,15,5.2.49,HOTSPUR,"O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,"
2839,Henry IV,15,5.2.50,HOTSPUR,And that no man might draw short breath today
2840,Henry IV,15,5.2.51,HOTSPUR,"But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,"
2841,Henry IV,15,5.2.52,HOTSPUR,How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
2842,Henry IV,16,5.2.53,VERNON,"No, by my soul, I never in my life"
2843,Henry IV,16,5.2.54,VERNON,"Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,"
2844,Henry IV,16,5.2.55,VERNON,Unless a brother should a brother dare
2845,Henry IV,16,5.2.56,VERNON,To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
2846,Henry IV,16,5.2.57,VERNON,"He gave you all the duties of a man,"
2847,Henry IV,16,5.2.58,VERNON,"Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,"
2848,Henry IV,16,5.2.59,VERNON,"Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,"
2849,Henry IV,16,5.2.60,VERNON,Making you ever better than his praise
2850,Henry IV,16,5.2.61,VERNON,"By still dispraising praise valued in you,"
2851,Henry IV,16,5.2.62,VERNON,"And, which became him like a prince indeed,"
2852,Henry IV,16,5.2.63,VERNON,"He made a blushing cital of himself,"
2853,Henry IV,16,5.2.64,VERNON,And chid his truant youth with such a grace
2854,Henry IV,16,5.2.65,VERNON,As if he master'd there a double spirit.
2855,Henry IV,16,5.2.66,VERNON,Of teaching and of learning instantly.
2856,Henry IV,16,5.2.67,VERNON,"There did he pause: but let me tell the world,"
2857,Henry IV,16,5.2.68,VERNON,"If he outlive the envy of this day,"
2858,Henry IV,16,5.2.69,VERNON,"England did never owe so sweet a hope,"
2859,Henry IV,16,5.2.70,VERNON,So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
2860,Henry IV,17,5.2.71,HOTSPUR,"Cousin, I think thou art enamoured"
2861,Henry IV,17,5.2.72,HOTSPUR,On his follies: never did I hear
2862,Henry IV,17,5.2.73,HOTSPUR,Of any prince so wild a libertine.
2863,Henry IV,17,5.2.74,HOTSPUR,"But be he as he will, yet once ere night"
2864,Henry IV,17,5.2.75,HOTSPUR,"I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,"
2865,Henry IV,17,5.2.76,HOTSPUR,That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
2866,Henry IV,17,5.2.77,HOTSPUR,"Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,"
2867,Henry IV,17,5.2.78,HOTSPUR,Better consider what you have to do
2868,Henry IV,17,5.2.79,HOTSPUR,"Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,"
2869,Henry IV,17,5.2.80,HOTSPUR,Can lift your blood up with persuasion.
2870,Henry IV,17,,HOTSPUR,Enter a Messenger
2871,Henry IV,18,5.2.81,Messenger,"My lord, here are letters for you."
2872,Henry IV,19,5.2.82,HOTSPUR,I cannot read them now.
2873,Henry IV,19,5.2.83,HOTSPUR,"O gentlemen, the time of life is short!"
2874,Henry IV,19,5.2.84,HOTSPUR,"To spend that shortness basely were too long,"
2875,Henry IV,19,5.2.85,HOTSPUR,"If life did ride upon a dial's point,"
2876,Henry IV,19,5.2.86,HOTSPUR,Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
2877,Henry IV,19,5.2.87,HOTSPUR,"An if we live, we live to tread on kings,"
2878,Henry IV,19,5.2.88,HOTSPUR,"If die, brave death, when princes die with us!"
2879,Henry IV,19,5.2.89,HOTSPUR,"Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,"
2880,Henry IV,19,5.2.90,HOTSPUR,When the intent of bearing them is just.
2881,Henry IV,19,,HOTSPUR,Enter another Messenger
2882,Henry IV,20,5.2.91,Messenger,"My lord, prepare, the king comes on apace."
2883,Henry IV,21,5.2.92,HOTSPUR,"I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,"
2884,Henry IV,21,5.2.93,HOTSPUR,"For I profess not talking, only this--"
2885,Henry IV,21,5.2.94,HOTSPUR,Let each man do his best: and here draw I
2886,Henry IV,21,5.2.95,HOTSPUR,"A sword, whose temper I intend to stain"
2887,Henry IV,21,5.2.96,HOTSPUR,With the best blood that I can meet withal
2888,Henry IV,21,5.2.97,HOTSPUR,In the adventure of this perilous day.
2889,Henry IV,21,5.2.98,HOTSPUR,"Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on."
2890,Henry IV,21,5.2.99,HOTSPUR,"Sound all the lofty instruments of war,"
2891,Henry IV,21,5.2.100,HOTSPUR,"And by that music let us all embrace,"
2892,Henry IV,21,5.2.101,HOTSPUR,"For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall"
2893,Henry IV,21,5.2.102,HOTSPUR,A second time do such a courtesy.
2894,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,"The trumpets sound. They embrace, and exeunt"
2895,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,SCENE III. Plain between the camps.
2896,Henry IV,21,,HOTSPUR,KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT
2897,Henry IV,1,5.3.1,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"What is thy name, that in the battle thus"
2898,Henry IV,1,5.3.2,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
2899,Henry IV,1,5.3.3,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Upon my head?
2900,Henry IV,2,5.3.4,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Know then, my name is Douglas,"
2901,Henry IV,2,5.3.5,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
2902,Henry IV,2,5.3.6,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Because some tell me that thou art a king.
2903,Henry IV,3,5.3.7,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They tell thee true.
2904,Henry IV,4,5.3.8,EARL OF DOUGLAS,The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
2905,Henry IV,4,5.3.9,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,"
2906,Henry IV,4,5.3.10,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,"
2907,Henry IV,4,5.3.11,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
2908,Henry IV,5,5.3.12,SIR WALTER BLUNT,"I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,"
2909,Henry IV,5,5.3.13,SIR WALTER BLUNT,And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
2910,Henry IV,5,5.3.14,SIR WALTER BLUNT,Lord Stafford's death.
2911,Henry IV,5,,SIR WALTER BLUNT,They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR
2912,Henry IV,6,5.3.15,HOTSPUR,"O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,"
2913,Henry IV,6,5.3.16,HOTSPUR,never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
2914,Henry IV,7,5.3.17,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"All's done, all's won, here breathless lies the king."
2915,Henry IV,8,5.3.18,HOTSPUR,Where?
2916,Henry IV,9,5.3.19,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Here.
2917,Henry IV,10,5.3.20,HOTSPUR,"This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:"
2918,Henry IV,10,5.3.21,HOTSPUR,"A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,"
2919,Henry IV,10,5.3.22,HOTSPUR,Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
2920,Henry IV,11,5.3.23,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!"
2921,Henry IV,11,5.3.24,EARL OF DOUGLAS,A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
2922,Henry IV,11,5.3.25,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
2923,Henry IV,12,5.3.26,HOTSPUR,The king hath many marching in his coats.
2924,Henry IV,13,5.3.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats,"
2925,Henry IV,13,5.3.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,"
2926,Henry IV,13,5.3.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Until I meet the king.
2927,Henry IV,14,5.3.30,HOTSPUR,"Up, and away!"
2928,Henry IV,14,5.3.31,HOTSPUR,Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.
2929,Henry IV,14,,HOTSPUR,Exeunt
2930,Henry IV,14,,HOTSPUR,"Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus"
2931,Henry IV,15,5.3.32,FALSTAFF,"Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear"
2932,Henry IV,15,5.3.33,FALSTAFF,"the shot here, here's no scoring but upon the pate."
2933,Henry IV,15,5.3.34,FALSTAFF,Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour
2934,Henry IV,15,5.3.35,FALSTAFF,for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
2935,Henry IV,15,5.3.36,FALSTAFF,"lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I"
2936,Henry IV,15,5.3.37,FALSTAFF,need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
2937,Henry IV,15,5.3.38,FALSTAFF,led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
2938,Henry IV,15,5.3.39,FALSTAFF,"not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and"
2939,Henry IV,15,5.3.40,FALSTAFF,"they are for the town's end, to beg during life."
2940,Henry IV,15,5.3.41,FALSTAFF,But who comes here?
2941,Henry IV,15,,FALSTAFF,Enter PRINCE HENRY
2942,Henry IV,16,5.3.42,PRINCE HENRY,"What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword:"
2943,Henry IV,16,5.3.43,PRINCE HENRY,Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
2944,Henry IV,16,5.3.44,PRINCE HENRY,"Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,"
2945,Henry IV,16,5.3.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,"
2946,Henry IV,16,5.3.46,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2947,Henry IV,17,5.3.47,FALSTAFF,"O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile."
2948,Henry IV,17,5.3.48,FALSTAFF,Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
2949,Henry IV,17,5.3.49,FALSTAFF,"done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure."
2950,Henry IV,18,5.3.50,PRINCE HENRY,"He is, indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee,"
2951,Henry IV,18,5.3.51,PRINCE HENRY,lend me thy sword.
2952,Henry IV,19,5.3.52,FALSTAFF,"Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st"
2953,Henry IV,19,5.3.53,FALSTAFF,"not my sword, but take my pistol, if thou wilt."
2954,Henry IV,20,5.3.54,PRINCE HENRY,"Give it to me: what, is it in the case?"
2955,Henry IV,21,5.3.55,FALSTAFF,"Ay, Hal, 'tis hot, 'tis hot, there's that will sack a city."
2956,Henry IV,21,,FALSTAFF,"PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack"
2957,Henry IV,22,5.3.56,PRINCE HENRY,"What, is it a time to jest and dally now?"
2958,Henry IV,22,,PRINCE HENRY,He throws the bottle at him. Exit
2959,Henry IV,23,5.3.57,FALSTAFF,"Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do"
2960,Henry IV,23,5.3.58,FALSTAFF,"come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his"
2961,Henry IV,23,5.3.59,FALSTAFF,"willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like"
2962,Henry IV,23,5.3.60,FALSTAFF,not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
2963,Henry IV,23,5.3.61,FALSTAFF,"life: which if I can save, so, if not, honour comes"
2964,Henry IV,23,5.3.62,FALSTAFF,"unlooked for, and there's an end."
2965,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,Exit FALSTAFF
2966,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,SCENE IV. Another part of the field.
2967,Henry IV,23,,FALSTAFF,"Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND"
2968,Henry IV,1,5.4.1,KING HENRY IV,"I prithee,"
2969,Henry IV,1,5.4.2,KING HENRY IV,"Harry, withdraw thyself, thou bleed'st too much."
2970,Henry IV,1,5.4.3,KING HENRY IV,"Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him."
2971,Henry IV,2,5.4.4,LANCASTER,"Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too."
2972,Henry IV,3,5.4.5,PRINCE HENRY,"I beseech your majesty, make up,"
2973,Henry IV,3,5.4.6,PRINCE HENRY,Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
2974,Henry IV,4,5.4.7,KING HENRY IV,I will do so.
2975,Henry IV,4,5.4.8,KING HENRY IV,"My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent."
2976,Henry IV,5,5.4.9,WESTMORELAND,"Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent."
2977,Henry IV,6,5.4.10,PRINCE HENRY,"Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:"
2978,Henry IV,6,5.4.11,PRINCE HENRY,And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
2979,Henry IV,6,5.4.12,PRINCE HENRY,"The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,"
2980,Henry IV,6,5.4.13,PRINCE HENRY,"Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,"
2981,Henry IV,6,5.4.14,PRINCE HENRY,and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
2982,Henry IV,7,5.4.15,LANCASTER,"We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,"
2983,Henry IV,7,5.4.16,LANCASTER,"Our duty this way lies, for God's sake come."
2984,Henry IV,7,,LANCASTER,Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND
2985,Henry IV,8,5.4.17,PRINCE HENRY,"By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster,"
2986,Henry IV,8,5.4.18,PRINCE HENRY,I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
2987,Henry IV,8,5.4.19,PRINCE HENRY,"Before, I loved thee as a brother, John,"
2988,Henry IV,8,5.4.20,PRINCE HENRY,"But now, I do respect thee as my soul."
2989,Henry IV,9,5.4.21,KING HENRY IV,I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
2990,Henry IV,9,5.4.22,KING HENRY IV,With lustier maintenance than I did look for
2991,Henry IV,9,5.4.23,KING HENRY IV,Of such an ungrown warrior.
2992,Henry IV,10,5.4.24,PRINCE HENRY,"O, this boy"
2993,Henry IV,10,5.4.25,PRINCE HENRY,Lends mettle to us all!
2994,Henry IV,10,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit
2995,Henry IV,10,,PRINCE HENRY,Enter DOUGLAS
2996,Henry IV,11,5.4.26,EARL OF DOUGLAS,Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
2997,Henry IV,11,5.4.27,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I am the Douglas, fatal to all those"
2998,Henry IV,11,5.4.28,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"That wear those colours on them: what art thou,"
2999,Henry IV,11,5.4.29,EARL OF DOUGLAS,That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
3000,Henry IV,12,5.4.30,KING HENRY IV,"The king himself, who, Douglas, grieves at heart"
3001,Henry IV,12,5.4.31,KING HENRY IV,So many of his shadows thou hast met
3002,Henry IV,12,5.4.32,KING HENRY IV,And not the very king. I have two boys
3003,Henry IV,12,5.4.33,KING HENRY IV,Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
3004,Henry IV,12,5.4.34,KING HENRY IV,"But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,"
3005,Henry IV,12,5.4.35,KING HENRY IV,"I will assay thee: so, defend thyself."
3006,Henry IV,13,5.4.36,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"I fear thou art another counterfeit,"
3007,Henry IV,13,5.4.37,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:"
3008,Henry IV,13,5.4.38,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,"
3009,Henry IV,13,5.4.39,EARL OF DOUGLAS,And thus I win thee.
3010,Henry IV,13,,EARL OF DOUGLAS,"They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE HENRY enters"
3011,Henry IV,14,5.4.40,PRINCE HENRY,"Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like"
3012,Henry IV,14,5.4.41,PRINCE HENRY,Never to hold it up again! the spirits
3013,Henry IV,14,5.4.42,PRINCE HENRY,"Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:"
3014,Henry IV,14,5.4.43,PRINCE HENRY,"It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,"
3015,Henry IV,14,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
3016,Henry IV,14,5.4.44,PRINCE HENRY,They fight: DOUGLAS flies
3017,Henry IV,14,5.4.45,PRINCE HENRY,"Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?"
3018,Henry IV,14,5.4.46,PRINCE HENRY,"Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,"
3019,Henry IV,14,5.4.47,PRINCE HENRY,And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
3020,Henry IV,15,5.4.48,KING HENRY IV,"Stay, and breathe awhile:"
3021,Henry IV,15,5.4.49,KING HENRY IV,"Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,"
3022,Henry IV,15,5.4.50,KING HENRY IV,"And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,"
3023,Henry IV,15,5.4.51,KING HENRY IV,In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
3024,Henry IV,16,5.4.52,PRINCE HENRY,O God! they did me too much injury
3025,Henry IV,16,5.4.53,PRINCE HENRY,That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
3026,Henry IV,16,5.4.54,PRINCE HENRY,"If it were so, I might have let alone"
3027,Henry IV,16,5.4.55,PRINCE HENRY,"The insulting hand of Douglas over you,"
3028,Henry IV,16,5.4.56,PRINCE HENRY,Which would have been as speedy in your end
3029,Henry IV,16,5.4.57,PRINCE HENRY,As all the poisonous potions in the world
3030,Henry IV,16,5.4.58,PRINCE HENRY,And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
3031,Henry IV,17,5.4.59,KING HENRY IV,Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
3032,Henry IV,17,,KING HENRY IV,Exit
3033,Henry IV,17,,KING HENRY IV,Enter HOTSPUR
3034,Henry IV,18,5.4.60,HOTSPUR,"If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth."
3035,Henry IV,19,5.4.61,PRINCE HENRY,Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
3036,Henry IV,20,5.4.62,HOTSPUR,My name is Harry Percy.
3037,Henry IV,21,5.4.63,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, then I see"
3038,Henry IV,21,5.4.64,PRINCE HENRY,A very valiant rebel of the name.
3039,Henry IV,21,5.4.65,PRINCE HENRY,"I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,"
3040,Henry IV,21,5.4.66,PRINCE HENRY,To share with me in glory any more:
3041,Henry IV,21,5.4.67,PRINCE HENRY,"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,"
3042,Henry IV,21,5.4.68,PRINCE HENRY,"Nor can one England brook a double reign,"
3043,Henry IV,21,5.4.69,PRINCE HENRY,Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
3044,Henry IV,22,5.4.70,HOTSPUR,"Nor shall it, Harry, for the hour is come"
3045,Henry IV,22,5.4.71,HOTSPUR,"To end the one of us, and would to God"
3046,Henry IV,22,5.4.72,HOTSPUR,Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
3047,Henry IV,23,5.4.73,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,"
3048,Henry IV,23,5.4.74,PRINCE HENRY,And all the budding honours on thy crest
3049,Henry IV,23,5.4.75,PRINCE HENRY,"I'll crop, to make a garland for my head."
3050,Henry IV,24,5.4.76,HOTSPUR,I can no longer brook thy vanities.
3051,Henry IV,24,,HOTSPUR,They fight
3052,Henry IV,24,,HOTSPUR,Enter FALSTAFF
3053,Henry IV,25,5.4.77,FALSTAFF,"Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no"
3054,Henry IV,25,5.4.78,FALSTAFF,"boy's play here, I can tell you."
3055,Henry IV,25,5.4.78,FALSTAFF,"Re-enter DOUGLAS, he fights with FALSTAFF,  who falls down as if he were dead, and exit DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls"
3056,Henry IV,26,5.4.79,HOTSPUR,"O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!"
3057,Henry IV,26,5.4.80,HOTSPUR,I better brook the loss of brittle life
3058,Henry IV,26,5.4.81,HOTSPUR,"Than those proud titles thou hast won of me,"
3059,Henry IV,26,5.4.82,HOTSPUR,They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
3060,Henry IV,26,5.4.83,HOTSPUR,"But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool,"
3061,Henry IV,26,5.4.84,HOTSPUR,"And time, that takes survey of all the world,"
3062,Henry IV,26,5.4.85,HOTSPUR,"Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,"
3063,Henry IV,26,5.4.86,HOTSPUR,But that the earthy and cold hand of death
3064,Henry IV,26,5.4.87,HOTSPUR,"Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust"
3065,Henry IV,26,5.4.88,HOTSPUR,And food for--
3066,Henry IV,26,,HOTSPUR,Dies
3067,Henry IV,27,5.4.89,PRINCE HENRY,"For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!"
3068,Henry IV,27,5.4.90,PRINCE HENRY,"Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!"
3069,Henry IV,27,5.4.91,PRINCE HENRY,"When that this body did contain a spirit,"
3070,Henry IV,27,5.4.92,PRINCE HENRY,"A kingdom for it was too small a bound,"
3071,Henry IV,27,5.4.93,PRINCE HENRY,But now two paces of the vilest earth
3072,Henry IV,27,5.4.94,PRINCE HENRY,Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
3073,Henry IV,27,5.4.95,PRINCE HENRY,Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
3074,Henry IV,27,5.4.96,PRINCE HENRY,"If thou wert sensible of courtesy,"
3075,Henry IV,27,5.4.97,PRINCE HENRY,I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
3076,Henry IV,27,5.4.98,PRINCE HENRY,"But let my favours hide thy mangled face,"
3077,Henry IV,27,5.4.99,PRINCE HENRY,"And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself"
3078,Henry IV,27,5.4.100,PRINCE HENRY,For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
3079,Henry IV,27,5.4.101,PRINCE HENRY,"Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!"
3080,Henry IV,27,5.4.102,PRINCE HENRY,"Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,"
3081,Henry IV,27,5.4.103,PRINCE HENRY,But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
3082,Henry IV,27,,PRINCE HENRY,He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground
3083,Henry IV,27,5.4.104,PRINCE HENRY,"What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh"
3084,Henry IV,27,5.4.105,PRINCE HENRY,"Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!"
3085,Henry IV,27,5.4.106,PRINCE HENRY,I could have better spared a better man:
3086,Henry IV,27,5.4.107,PRINCE HENRY,"O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,"
3087,Henry IV,27,5.4.108,PRINCE HENRY,If I were much in love with vanity!
3088,Henry IV,27,5.4.109,PRINCE HENRY,"Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,"
3089,Henry IV,27,5.4.110,PRINCE HENRY,"Though many dearer, in this bloody fray."
3090,Henry IV,27,5.4.111,PRINCE HENRY,Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
3091,Henry IV,27,5.4.112,PRINCE HENRY,Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
3092,Henry IV,27,,PRINCE HENRY,Exit PRINCE HENRY
3093,Henry IV,28,5.4.113,FALSTAFF,"[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,"
3094,Henry IV,28,5.4.114,FALSTAFF,I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
3095,Henry IV,28,5.4.115,FALSTAFF,"to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or"
3096,Henry IV,28,5.4.116,FALSTAFF,that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
3097,Henry IV,28,5.4.117,FALSTAFF,"Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,"
3098,Henry IV,28,5.4.118,FALSTAFF,"is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the"
3099,Henry IV,28,5.4.119,FALSTAFF,counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
3100,Henry IV,28,5.4.120,FALSTAFF,"but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby"
3101,Henry IV,28,5.4.121,FALSTAFF,"liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and"
3102,Henry IV,28,5.4.122,FALSTAFF,perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
3103,Henry IV,28,5.4.123,FALSTAFF,"valour is discretion, in the which better part I"
3104,Henry IV,28,5.4.124,FALSTAFF,"have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this"
3105,Henry IV,28,5.4.125,FALSTAFF,"gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he"
3106,Henry IV,28,5.4.126,FALSTAFF,"should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am"
3107,Henry IV,28,5.4.127,FALSTAFF,afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
3108,Henry IV,28,5.4.128,FALSTAFF,"Therefore I'll make him sure, yea, and I'll swear I"
3109,Henry IV,28,5.4.129,FALSTAFF,killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
3110,Henry IV,28,5.4.130,FALSTAFF,"Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me."
3111,Henry IV,28,5.4.131,FALSTAFF,"Therefore, sirrah,"
3112,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Stabbing him
3113,Henry IV,28,5.4.132,FALSTAFF,"with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me."
3114,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Takes up HOTSPUR on his back
3115,Henry IV,28,,FALSTAFF,Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER
3116,Henry IV,29,5.4.133,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother John, full bravely hast thou flesh'd"
3117,Henry IV,29,5.4.134,PRINCE HENRY,Thy maiden sword.
3118,Henry IV,30,5.4.135,LANCASTER,"But, soft! whom have we here?"
3119,Henry IV,30,5.4.136,LANCASTER,Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
3120,Henry IV,31,5.4.137,PRINCE HENRY,"I did, I saw him dead,"
3121,Henry IV,31,5.4.138,PRINCE HENRY,Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
3122,Henry IV,31,5.4.139,PRINCE HENRY,thou alive?
3123,Henry IV,31,5.4.140,PRINCE HENRY,Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
3124,Henry IV,31,5.4.141,PRINCE HENRY,"I prithee, speak, we will not trust our eyes"
3125,Henry IV,31,5.4.142,PRINCE HENRY,Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
3126,Henry IV,32,5.4.143,FALSTAFF,"No, that's certain, I am not a double man: but if I"
3127,Henry IV,32,5.4.144,FALSTAFF,"be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:"
3128,Henry IV,32,,FALSTAFF,Throwing the body down
3129,Henry IV,32,5.4.145,FALSTAFF,"if your father will do me any honour, so, if not, let"
3130,Henry IV,32,5.4.146,FALSTAFF,him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
3131,Henry IV,32,5.4.147,FALSTAFF,"earl or duke, I can assure you."
3132,Henry IV,33,5.4.148,PRINCE HENRY,"Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead."
3133,Henry IV,34,5.4.149,FALSTAFF,"Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to"
3134,Henry IV,34,5.4.150,FALSTAFF,"lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath,"
3135,Henry IV,34,5.4.151,FALSTAFF,and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
3136,Henry IV,34,5.4.152,FALSTAFF,fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
3137,Henry IV,34,5.4.153,FALSTAFF,"believed, so, if not, let them that should reward"
3138,Henry IV,34,5.4.154,FALSTAFF,valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
3139,Henry IV,34,5.4.155,FALSTAFF,"it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the"
3140,Henry IV,34,5.4.156,FALSTAFF,"thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,"
3141,Henry IV,34,5.4.157,FALSTAFF,"'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword."
3142,Henry IV,35,5.4.158,LANCASTER,This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
3143,Henry IV,36,5.4.159,PRINCE HENRY,"This is the strangest fellow, brother John."
3144,Henry IV,36,5.4.160,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:"
3145,Henry IV,36,5.4.161,PRINCE HENRY,"For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,"
3146,Henry IV,36,5.4.162,PRINCE HENRY,I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
3147,Henry IV,36,,PRINCE HENRY,A retreat is sounded
3148,Henry IV,36,5.4.163,PRINCE HENRY,"The trumpet sounds retreat, the day is ours."
3149,Henry IV,36,5.4.164,PRINCE HENRY,"Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,"
3150,Henry IV,36,5.4.165,PRINCE HENRY,"To see what friends are living, who are dead."
3151,Henry IV,36,,PRINCE HENRY,Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER
3152,Henry IV,37,5.4.166,FALSTAFF,"I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that"
3153,Henry IV,37,5.4.167,FALSTAFF,"rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,"
3154,Henry IV,37,5.4.168,FALSTAFF,"I'll grow less, for I'll purge, and leave sack, and"
3155,Henry IV,37,5.4.169,FALSTAFF,live cleanly as a nobleman should do.
3156,Henry IV,37,,FALSTAFF,Exit
3157,Henry IV,37,,FALSTAFF,SCENE V. Another part of the field.
3158,Henry IV,37,,FALSTAFF,"The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE  HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners"
3159,Henry IV,1,5.5.1,KING HENRY IV,Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
3160,Henry IV,1,5.5.2,KING HENRY IV,"Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,"
3161,Henry IV,1,5.5.3,KING HENRY IV,Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
3162,Henry IV,1,5.5.4,KING HENRY IV,And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
3163,Henry IV,1,5.5.5,KING HENRY IV,Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
3164,Henry IV,1,5.5.6,KING HENRY IV,"Three knights upon our party slain to-day,"
3165,Henry IV,1,5.5.7,KING HENRY IV,A noble earl and many a creature else
3166,Henry IV,1,5.5.8,KING HENRY IV,"Had been alive this hour,"
3167,Henry IV,1,5.5.9,KING HENRY IV,If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
3168,Henry IV,1,5.5.10,KING HENRY IV,Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
3169,Henry IV,2,5.5.11,EARL OF WORCESTER,"What I have done my safety urged me to,"
3170,Henry IV,2,5.5.12,EARL OF WORCESTER,"And I embrace this fortune patiently,"
3171,Henry IV,2,5.5.13,EARL OF WORCESTER,Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
3172,Henry IV,3,5.5.14,KING HENRY IV,Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
3173,Henry IV,3,5.5.15,KING HENRY IV,Other offenders we will pause upon.
3174,Henry IV,3,,KING HENRY IV,"Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded"
3175,Henry IV,3,5.5.16,KING HENRY IV,How goes the field?
3176,Henry IV,4,5.5.17,PRINCE HENRY,"The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw"
3177,Henry IV,4,5.5.18,PRINCE HENRY,"The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,"
3178,Henry IV,4,5.5.19,PRINCE HENRY,"The noble Percy slain, and all his men"
3179,Henry IV,4,5.5.20,PRINCE HENRY,"Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,"
3180,Henry IV,4,5.5.21,PRINCE HENRY,"And falling from a hill, he was so bruised"
3181,Henry IV,4,5.5.22,PRINCE HENRY,That the pursuers took him. At my tent
3182,Henry IV,4,5.5.23,PRINCE HENRY,"The Douglas is, and I beseech your grace"
3183,Henry IV,4,5.5.24,PRINCE HENRY,I may dispose of him.
3184,Henry IV,5,5.5.25,KING HENRY IV,With all my heart.
3185,Henry IV,6,5.5.26,PRINCE HENRY,"Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you"
3186,Henry IV,6,5.5.27,PRINCE HENRY,This honourable bounty shall belong:
3187,Henry IV,6,5.5.28,PRINCE HENRY,"Go to the Douglas, and deliver him"
3188,Henry IV,6,5.5.29,PRINCE HENRY,"Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:"
3189,Henry IV,6,5.5.30,PRINCE HENRY,His valour shown upon our crests to-day
3190,Henry IV,6,5.5.31,PRINCE HENRY,Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
3191,Henry IV,6,5.5.32,PRINCE HENRY,Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
3192,Henry IV,7,5.5.33,LANCASTER,"I thank your grace for this high courtesy,"
3193,Henry IV,7,5.5.34,LANCASTER,Which I shall give away immediately.
3194,Henry IV,8,5.5.35,KING HENRY IV,"Then this remains, that we divide our power."
3195,Henry IV,8,5.5.36,KING HENRY IV,"You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland"
3196,Henry IV,8,5.5.37,KING HENRY IV,"Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,"
3197,Henry IV,8,5.5.38,KING HENRY IV,"To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,"
3198,Henry IV,8,5.5.39,KING HENRY IV,"Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:"
3199,Henry IV,8,5.5.40,KING HENRY IV,"Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,"
3200,Henry IV,8,5.5.41,KING HENRY IV,To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
3201,Henry IV,8,5.5.42,KING HENRY IV,"Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,"
3202,Henry IV,8,5.5.43,KING HENRY IV,Meeting the cheque of such another day:
3203,Henry IV,8,5.5.44,KING HENRY IV,"And since this business so fair is done,"
3204,Henry IV,8,5.5.45,KING HENRY IV,Let us not leave till all our own be won.
3205,Henry IV,8,,KING HENRY IV,Exeunt
