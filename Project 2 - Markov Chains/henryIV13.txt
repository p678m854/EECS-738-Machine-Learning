"An if the devil come and roar for them,"
"I will not send them: I will after straight"
"And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,"
"Albeit I make a hazard of my head."
"What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:"
"Here comes your uncle."
"Speak of Mortimer!"
"'Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul"
"Want mercy, if I do not join with him:"
"Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,"
"And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,"
"But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer"
"As high in the air as this unthankful king,"
"As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke."
"Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad."
"Who struck this heat up after I was gone?"
"He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,"
"And when I urged the ransom once again"
"Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,"
"And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,"
"Trembling even at the name of Mortimer."
"I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd"
"By Richard that dead is the next of blood?"
"He was, I heard the proclamation:"
"And then it was when the unhappy king,"
"--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth"
"Upon his Irish expedition,"
"From whence he intercepted did return"
"To be deposed and shortly murdered."
